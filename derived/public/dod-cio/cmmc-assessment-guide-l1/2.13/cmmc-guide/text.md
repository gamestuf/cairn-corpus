                                                                                     Introduction




Introduction
This document provides guidance in the preparation for and execution of a Level 1 self-
assessment under the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program as set
forth in section 170.15 of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Guidance for
conducting a Level 2 self-assessment or certification assessment can be found in CMMC
Assessment Guide – Level 2. Guidance for conducting a Level 3 certification assessment can
be found in CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3. More details on the CMMC Model can be found
in CMMC Model Overview.
Level 1 focuses on the protection of Federal Contract Information (FCI), which is defined in
32 CFR § 170.4 and 48 CFR § 4.1901:
        Federal contract information means information, not intended for public
        release, that is provided by or generated for the Government under a contract to
        develop or deliver a product or service to the Government, but not including
        information provided by the Government to the public (such as on public
        websites) or simple transactional information, such as necessary to process
        payments.
Level 1 is comprised of the 15 basic safeguarding requirements specified in Federal
Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Clause 52.204-21.
Purpose and Audience
This guide is intended for Organizations Seeking Assessment (OSAs), cybersecurity
professionals, and individuals and companies that support CMMC efforts. This document can
be used as part of preparation for and conducting a Level 1 self-assessment.
Document Organization
This document is organized into the following sections:
•   Assessment and Compliance: provides an overview of the Level 1 self-assessment
    process set forth in 32 CFR § 170.15, describes ways of documenting compliance, and
    provides guidance regarding OSA size and the self-assessment scope requirements set
    forth in 32 CFR § 170.19.
•   CMMC-Custom Terms: incorporates definitions from 32 CFR § 170.4 and definitions
    included by reference from 32 CFR § 170.2, and provides clarification of the intent and
    scope of custom terms as used in the context of CMMC.
•   Assessment Criteria and Methodology: provides guidance on criteria and
    methodology (i.e., interview, examine, and test) that may be employed during a Level 1
    self-assessment, as well as on assessment findings.
•   Requirement Descriptions: provides guidance specific to each Level 1 security
    requirement.



 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                             1


                                                                        Assessment and Compliance




Assessment and Compliance
Level 1 self-assessment requirements are set forth in 32 CFR § 170.15. The OSA will assess
its own contractor information system(s) to determine if it meet all the basic safeguarding
requirements for FCI specified in FAR Clause 52.204-21. OSAs should use the self-assessment
methods as described in 32 CFR § 170.15.
Level 1 requirements may apply to an entire enterprise infrastructure or to a particular
enclave(s), depending upon where the FCI will be processed, stored, or transmitted.
OSAs can choose to perform the annual self-assessment internally or engage a third party to
assist. Use of a third party to assist is still considered a self-assessment and does not result
in a certification. The primary result of a self-assessment is the submission of Level 1
compliance results into the Supplier Performance Risk System (SPRS) and a self-assessment
report, which contains the findings associated with the self- assessment.

Assessment Scope
Prior to conducting a Level 1 self-assessment, the OSA must specify the CMMC Assessment
Scope as defined in 32 CFR § 170.19(a). The CMMC Assessment Scope identifies which assets
within the OSA’s environment will be assessed and the details of the self-assessment. In
accordance with §170.19, for a Level 1 self-assessment, the assets that process, store, or
transmit FCI are considered in-scope and should be assessed against the Level 1
requirements. See the CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 1 document for additional information.

                                                                            CMMC-Custom Terms




CMMC-Custom Terms
The CMMC Program has custom terms that align with program requirements. Although some
terms may have other definitions in open forums, it is important to understand these terms
as they apply to the CMMC Program.
The custom terms associated with Level 1 are:
•   Assessment: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means the testing or evaluation of security
    controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
    security requirements for an information system or organization, as defined in 32 CFR §
    170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18.
        o Level 1 self-assessment is the term for the activity performed by an OSA to
          evaluate its own information system, when seeking a CMMC Status of Final Level
          1 (Self).
•   Assessment Objective: A set of determination statements that, taken together,
    expresses the desired outcome for the assessment of a security requirement. Successful
    implementation of the corresponding CMMC security requirement requires meeting all
    applicable assessment objectives defined in NIST SP 800–171A or NIST SP 800-172A.
•   Asset: An item of value to stakeholders. An asset may be tangible (e.g., a physical item
    such as hardware, firmware, computing platform, network device, or other technology
    component) or intangible (e.g., humans, data, information, software, capability, function,
    service, trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual property, image, or reputation). The
    value of an asset is determined by stakeholders in consideration of loss concerns across
    the entire system life cycle. Such concerns include but are not limited to business or
    mission concerns, as defined in NIST SP 800-160 Rev 1.
•   CMMC Status: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 is the result of meeting or exceeding the
    minimum required score for the corresponding assessment. The CMMC Status of an OSA
    information system is officially stored in SPRS and additionally presented on a Certificate
    of CMMC Status, if the assessment was conducted by a C3PAO or DCMA DIBCAC.
        o Final Level 1 (Self) is defined in § 170.15(c)(1). To achieve a CMMC Status of Final
          Level 1 (Self) the OSA must conduct a Level 1 self-assessment scored in
          accordance with the CMMC Scoring Methodology described in § 170.24. The Level

# 1 self-assessment must be performed in accordance with the Level 1 scope

requirements set forth in § 170.19(a) and (b). In instances where an objective
          addresses CUI, the term FCI should be substituted for CUI.
•   Component: A discrete identifiable information technology asset that represents a
    building block of a system and may include hardware, software, and firmware 1. A
    component is one type of asset.

# 1 NIST SP 800-171 Rev 2, p 59 under system component

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                           3


                                                                           CMMC-Custom Terms



•   Enduring Exception: A special circumstance or system where remediation and full
    compliance with CMMC security requirements is not feasible. Examples include systems
    required to replicate the configuration of ‘fielded’ systems, medical devices, test
    equipment, OT, and IoT. No operational plan of action is required but the circumstance
    must be documented within a system security plan. Specialized Assets and GFE may be
    Enduring Exceptions.
•   Information System (IS): A discrete set of information resources organized for the
    collection, processing, maintenance, use, sharing, dissemination, or disposition of
    information [NIST 800-171 Rev. 2]. An IS is one type of asset.
•   Monitoring: Continual checking, supervising, critically observing, or determining the
    status in order to identify change from the performance level required or expected [NIST
    SP 800-160 Vol 1].
•   Operational plan of action: As used in security requirement CA.L2-3.12.2, means the
    formal artifact which identifies temporary vulnerabilities and temporary deficiencies in
    implementation of requirements and documents how and when they will be mitigated,
    corrected, or eliminated. The OSA defines the format (e.g., document, spreadsheet,
    database) and specific content of its operational plan of action. An operational plan of
    action is not the same as a POA&M associated with an assessment.
•   Organization-Defined: As determined by the OSA being assessed except as defined in
    the case of Organization-Defined Parameter (ODP). This can be applied to a frequency or
    rate at which something occurs within a given time period, or it could be associated with
    describing the configuration of an OSA’s solution.
•   Temporary deficiency: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means a condition where
    remediation of a discovered deficiency is feasible and a known fix is available or is in
    process. The deficiency must be documented in an operational plan of action. A
    temporary deficiency is not based on an ‘in progress’ initial implementation of a CMMC
    security requirement but arises after implementation. A temporary deficiency may
    apply during the initial implementation of a security requirement if, during roll-out,
    specific issues with a very limited subset of equipment is discovered that must be
    separately addressed. There is no standard duration for which a temporary deficiency
    may be active. For example, FIPS-validated cryptography that requires a patch and the
    patched version is no longer the validated version may be a temporary deficiency.

                                                                          Assessment Criteria and Methodology




Assessment Criteria and Methodology
This CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 provides guidance regarding the assessment
procedures required by 32 CFR § 170.15, which requires the Level 1 self-assessment to be
performed using the objectives defined in NIST Special Publication (SP) 800-171A 2. NIST SP
800-171A Section 2.1 says the following:
        An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of
        potential assessment methods and assessment objects that can be used to
        conduct the assessment. Each assessment objective includes a determination
        statement related to the requirement that is the subject of the assessment. The
        determination statements are linked to the content of the requirement to ensure
        traceability of the assessment results to the requirements. The application of an
        assessment procedure to a requirement produces assessment findings. These
        findings reflect, or are subsequently used, to help determine if the requirement
        has been satisfied.
        Assessment objects identify the specific items being assessed and can include
        specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals.
             •   Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies,
                 procedures, security plans, security requirements, functional
                 specifications, and architectural designs) associated with a system.
             •   Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards
                 employed within a system.
             •   Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that
                 involve people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising a
                 contingency plan, and monitoring network traffic).
             •   Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the
                 specifications, mechanisms, or activities described above.
        The assessment methods define the nature and the extent of the assessor’s
        actions. The methods include examine, interview, and test.
             •   The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing,
                 studying, or analyzing assessment objects (i.e., specifications,
                 mechanisms, activities). The purpose of the examine method is to
                 facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or obtain evidence.
             •   The interview method is the process of holding discussions with
                 individuals or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve
                 clarification, or obtain evidence.




2 NIST SP 800-171A, Assessing Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information, June 2018 (italics

and bulleted list formatting altered)

 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                                           5


                                                                  Assessment Criteria and Methodology



            •   And finally, the test method is the process of exercising assessment objects
                (i.e., activities, mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual
                with expected behavior.
            In all three assessment methods, the results are used in making specific
            determinations called for in the determination statements and thereby
            achieving the objectives for the assessment procedure.
The guidance specified in NIST SP 800-171A focuses on Controlled Unclassified Information
(CUI). Since Level 1 focuses on safeguarding FCI, the applicable self-assessment objectives
for Level 1 are modified to address FCI rather than CUI as set forth in 32 CFR §
170.15(c)(1)(i). Where CUI is noted in a NIST SP 800-171A assessment objective, [FCI] has
been substituted in the Level 1 objective description. Level 1 security requirement
descriptions align with FAR Clause 52.204-21.

Criteria
Assessment objectives are provided for each Level 1 requirement and are based on existing
criteria in NIST SP 800-171A modified for FCI rather than CUI as set forth in 32 CFR §
170.15(c)(1)(i). The criteria are authoritative and provide the basis for the self-assessment
of a requirement.

Methodology
To verify and validate that an OSA is meeting CMMC requirements, evidence needs to exist
demonstrating that the OSA has fulfilled the objectives of the Level 1 requirements. Because
different self-assessment objectives can be met in different ways (e.g., through
documentation, computer configuration, network configuration, or training), a variety of
techniques may be used to determine if the OSA meets the Level 1 requirements, including
any of the three assessment methods from NIST SP 800-171A.
Follow the guidance in NIST SP 800-171A when determining which assessment methods to
use:
        Organizations [OSAs] are not expected to employ all assessment methods and
        objects contained within the assessment procedures identified in this
        publication. Rather, organizations have the flexibility to determine the level of
        effort needed and the assurance required for an assessment (e.g., which
        assessment methods and assessment objects are deemed to be the most useful in
        obtaining the desired results). This determination is made based on how the
        organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective
        manner and with sufficient confidence to support the determination that the
        [FCI] requirements have been satisfied.
For more detailed information on assessment methods, see NIST SP 800-171A Appendix D.




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                                 6


                                                              Assessment Criteria and Methodology



Who Is Interviewed

Interviews of applicable staff (possibly at different organizational levels) may provide
information to help an entity determine if Level 1 security requirements have been
implemented, as well as if adequate resourcing, training, and planning have occurred for
individuals to implement the security requirements.

What Is Examined

Examination includes reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment
objects. The objects can be documents, mechanisms, or activities.
For some security requirements, review of documentation may assist an entity in
determining if the assessment objectives have been met. Interviews with staff may help
identify relevant documents. As set forth in 32 CFR § 170.24, documents need to be in their
final forms; drafts of policies or documentation are not eligible to be used as evidence
because they are not yet official and still subject to change. Common types of documents that
may be used as evidence include:
•   policy, process, and procedure documents;
•   training materials;
•   plans and planning documents; and
•   system, network, and data flow diagrams.
This list of documents is not exhaustive or prescriptive. An OSA may not have these specific
documents, and other documents may be reviewed.
In other cases, the security requirement is best self-assessed by observing that safeguards
are in place by viewing hardware, associated configuration information, or observing staff
following a process.

What Is Tested

Testing is an important part of the self-assessment process. Interviews provide information
about what the OSA staff believe to be true, documentation provides evidence of
implementing policies and procedures, and testing demonstrates what has or has not been
done. For example, OSA staff may talk about how users are identified, documentation may
provide details on how users are identified, but seeing a demonstration of identifying users
provides evidence that the requirement is met. Not all security requirements utilize testing
to allow an entity to determine if whether the assessment objective has been met.




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                             7


                                                               Assessment Criteria and Methodology



Assessment Findings
The self-assessment of a CMMC requirement results in one of three possible findings: MET,
NOT MET, or NOT APPLICABLE as defined in 32 CFR § 170.24. To demonstrate Level 1
compliance, the OSA will need a finding of MET or NOT APPLICABLE on all Level 1 security
requirements.
•   MET: All applicable objectives for the security requirement are satisfied based on
    evidence. All evidence must be in final form and not draft. Unacceptable forms of
    evidence include working papers, drafts, and unofficial or unapproved policies. For each
    security requirement marked MET, it is best practice to record statements that indicate
    the response conforms to all objectives and document the appropriate evidence to
    support the response.
        o Enduring Exceptions when described, along with any mitigations, in the system
          security plan shall be assessed as MET.
        o Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in operational plans of
          action (i.e., include deficiency reviews, milestones, and show progress towards
          the implementation of corrections to reduce or eliminate identified
          vulnerabilities) shall be assessed as MET.
•   NOT MET: One or more objectives of the security requirement is not satisfied. For each
    security requirement marked NOT MET, it is best practice to record statements that
    explain why and document the appropriate evidence showing that the OSA does not
    conform fully to all of the objectives.
•   NOT APPLICABLE (N/A): A security requirement and/or objective do not apply at the
    time of the assessment. For each security requirement marked N/A, it is best practice to
    record a statement that explains why the requirement does not apply to the OSA. For
    example, SC.L1-b.1.xi might be N/A if there are no publicly accessible systems within the
    CMMC Assessment Scope. During an assessment, an assessment objective assessed as
    N/A is equivalent to the same assessment objective being assessed as MET.
    Each assessment objective in NIST SP 800-171A must yield a finding of MET or NOT
    APPLICABLE in order for the overall security requirement to be scored as MET. Assessors
    exercise judgment in determining when sufficient and adequate evidence has been
    presented to make an assessment finding.
    CMMC assessments are conducted and results are captured at the assessment objective
    level. One NOT MET Assessment Objective results in a failure of the entire security
    requirement.
    A security requirement can be applicable even when assessment objectives included in
    the security requirement are scored N/A. The security requirement is NOT MET when
    one or more applicable assessment objectives is NOT MET.
    Satisfaction of security requirements may be accomplished by other parts of the
    enterprise or an External Service Provider (ESP), as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4. A security
    requirement is considered MET if adequate evidence is provided that the enterprise or

  ESP implements the requirement objectives. An ESP may be external people, technology,
  or facilities that the OSA uses, including cloud service providers, managed service
  providers, managed security service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers.

Requirement Descriptions
Introduction
This section provides detailed information and guidance for assessing each Level 1 security
requirement. The section is organized first by domain and then by individual security
requirement. Each security requirement description contains the following elements as

Test
[SELECT FROM: Organizational processes for managing system accounts; mechanisms for
implementing account management].

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 6

Access control policies (e.g., identity- or role-based policies, control matrices, and
cryptography) control access between active entities or subjects (i.e., users or processes
acting on behalf of users) and passive entities or objects (e.g., devices, files, records, and
domains) in systems. Access enforcement mechanisms can be employed at the application
and service level to provide increased information security. Other systems include systems
internal and external to the organization. This requirement focuses on account management
for systems and applications. The definition of and enforcement of access authorizations,
other than those determined by account type (e.g., privileged verses [sic] non-privileged) are
addressed in AC.L1-b.1.ii.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Identify users, processes, and devices that are allowed to use company computers and can
log on to the company network. Automated updates and other automatic processes should
be associated with the user who initiated (authorized) the process. Limit the devices (e.g.,
printers) that can be accessed by company computers. Set up your system so that only
authorized users, processes, and devices can access the company network.
This requirement, AC.L1-b.1.i, controls system access based on user, process, or device
identity. AC.L1-b.1.i leverages IA.L1-b.1.v which provides a vetted and trusted identity for
access control.

Example 1
Your company maintains a list of all personnel authorized to use company information
systems [a]. This list is used to support identification and authentication activities conducted
by IT when authorizing access to systems [a,d].

Example 2
A coworker wants to buy a new multi-function printer/scanner/fax device and make it
available on the company network. You explain that the company controls system and device
access to the network, and will prevent network access by unauthorized systems and devices
[c]. You help the coworker submit a ticket that asks for the printer to be granted access to
the network, and appropriate leadership approves the device [f].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Is a list of authorized users maintained that defines their identities and roles [a]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 8

Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type
of account, or a combination of both. System account types include individual, shared, group,
system, anonymous, guest, emergency, developer, manufacturer, vendor, and temporary.
Other attributes required for authorizing access include restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-
week, and point-of -origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider
system-related requirements (e.g., system upgrades scheduled maintenance,) and mission
or business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote
access to support travel requirements).

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Limit users to only the information systems, roles, or applications they are permitted to use
and require for their roles and responsibilities. Limit access to applications and data based
on authorized users’ roles and responsibilities. Common types of functions a user can be
assigned are create, read, update, and delete.

Example
You supervise the team that manages DoD contracts for your company. Members of your
team need to access the contract information to perform their work properly. Because some
of that data contains FCI, you work with IT to set up your group’s systems so that users can
be assigned access based on their specific roles [a]. Each role limits whether an employee
has read-access or create/read/delete/update -access [b]. Implementing this access control
restricts access to FCI information unless specifically authorized.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are access control lists used to limit access to applications and data based on role and/or
    identity [a]?
•   Is access for authorized users restricted to those parts of the system they are explicitly
    permitted to use, that is, is access denied by default and allowed by exception (e.g., a
    person who only performs word-processing cannot access developer tools) [b]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 10

External systems are systems or components of systems for which organizations typically
have no direct supervision and authority over the application of security requirements and
controls or the determination of the effectiveness of implemented controls on those systems.
External systems include personally owned systems, components, or devices and privately-
owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities.

CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1 | Version 2.13                                                    17


                                                         AC.L1-b.1.iii – External Connections [FCI Data]



This requirement also addresses the use of external systems for the processing, storage, or
transmission of FCI, including accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service,
platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational systems.
Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external systems in accordance
with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a
minimum, the types of applications that can be accessed on organizational systems from
external systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external systems cannot be
established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those
external systems.
This requirement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external
systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational systems. In those
situations, organizations need confidence that the external systems contain the necessary
controls so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational systems.
Verification that the required controls have been effectively implemented can be achieved
by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the
assurance or confidence level required by organizations.
Note that while “external” typically refers to outside of the organization’s direct supervision
and authority, that is not always the case. Regarding the protection of FCI across an
organization, the organization may have systems that process FCI and others that do not.
And among the systems that process FCI there are likely access restrictions for FCI that apply
between systems. Therefore, from the perspective of a given system, other systems within
the organization may be considered “external" to that system.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Control and manage connections between your company network and outside networks.
Outside networks could include the public internet, one of your own company’s networks
that falls outside of your CMMC Assessment Scope (e.g., an isolated lab), or a network that
does not belong to your company. Tools to manage connections include firewalls and
connection allow/deny lists. External systems not controlled by your company could be
running applications that are prohibited or blocked. Control and limit access to corporate
networks from personally owned devices such as laptops, tablets, and phones. You may
choose to limit how and when your network is connected to outside systems or only allow
certain employees to connect to outside systems from network resources.

Example
Your company has just been awarded a contract which contains FCI. You remind your
coworkers of the policy requirement to use their company laptops, not personal laptops or
tablets, when working remotely on this contract [b,f]. You also remind everyone to work
from the cloud environment that is approved for processing and storing FCI rather than the
other collaborative tools that may be used for other projects [b,f].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are all connections to external systems outside of the assessment scope identified [a]?
•   Are external systems (e.g., systems managed by OSAs, partners, or vendors; personal
    devices) that are permitted to connect to or make use of organizational systems
    identified [b]?
•   Are methods employed to ensure that only authorized connections are being made to
    external systems (e.g., requiring log-ins or certificates, access from a specific IP address,
    or access via VPN) [c,e]?
•   Are methods employed to confirm that only authorized external systems are connecting
    (e.g., if employees are receiving company email on personal cell phones, is the OSA
    checking to verify that only known/expected devices are connecting) [d]?
•   Is the use of external systems limited, including by policy or physical control [f]?

are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without
identification or authentication. Individuals authorized to post FCI onto publicly accessible
systems are designated. The content of information is reviewed prior to posting onto
publicly accessible systems to ensure that nonpublic information is not included.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Only government officials can be authorized to publicly release FCI. Do not allow FCI to
become public – always safeguard the confidentiality of FCI by controlling the posting of FCI
on company-controlled websites or public forums and the exposure of FCI in public
presentations or on public displays. It is important to know which users are allowed to
publish information on publicly accessible systems, like your company website, and
implement a review process before posting such information. If FCI is discovered on a
publicly accessible system, procedures should be in place to remove that information and
alert the appropriate parties.

Example
Your company decides to start issuing press releases about its projects in an effort to reach
more potential customers. Your company receives FCI from the government as part of its
DoD contract. Because you recognize the need to manage controlled information, including
FCI, you meet with the employees who write the releases and post information to establish
a review process [c]. It is decided that you will review press releases for FCI before posting
it on the company website [a,d]. Only certain employees will be authorized to post to the
website [a].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does information on externally facing systems (e.g., publicly accessible) have a
    documented approval chain for public release [c]?

applicable to shared system accounts. Typically, individual identifiers are the user names
associated with the system accounts assigned to those individuals. Organizations may
require unique identification of individuals in group accounts or for detailed accountability
of individual activity. In addition, this requirement addresses individual identifiers that are
not necessarily associated with system accounts. Organizational devices requiring

identification may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device.
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Individual, unique identifiers (e.g., user names) should be assigned to all users and processes
that access company systems. Authorized devices also should have unique identifiers.
Unique identifiers can be as simple as a short set of alphanumeric characters (e.g., SW001
could refer to a network switch, SW002 could refer to a different network switch).
This requirement, IA.L1-b.1.v, provides a vetted and trusted identity that supports the access
control mechanism required by AC.L1-b.1.i.

Example
You want to make sure that all employees working on a project can access important
information about it. Because this is work for the DoD and contains FCI, you also need to
prevent employees who are not working on that project from being able to access the
information. You assign each employee a unique user ID, which they use to log on to the
system [a].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are unique identifiers issued to individual users (e.g., usernames) [a]?
•   Are the processes and service accounts that an authorized user initiates identified (e.g.,
    scripts, automatic updates, configuration updates, vulnerability scans) [b]?
•   Are unique device identifiers used for devices that access the system identified [c]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 16

Individual authenticators include the following: passwords, key cards, cryptographic
devices, and one-time password devices. Initial authenticator content is the actual content
of the authenticator, for example, the initial password. In contrast, the requirements about
authenticator content include the minimum password length. Developers ship system
components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation

and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well known, easily
discoverable, and present a significant security risk.
Systems support authenticator management by organization-defined settings and
restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including minimum password length,
validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed
rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Authenticator
management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for
temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators
include certificates and passwords.
NIST SP 800-63-3 provides guidance on digital identities.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Before a person or device is given system access, verify that the user or device is who or what
it claims to be. This verification is called authentication. The most common way to verify
identity is using a username and a hard-to-guess password.
Some devices ship with a default username (e.g., admin) and password. A default username
and password should be immediately changed to something unique. Default passwords may
be well known to the public, easily found in a search, or easy to guess, allowing an
unauthorized person to access the system.

Example 1
You are in charge of purchasing laptops that will store FCI. You know that some laptops come
with a default username and password. You notify IT that all default passwords should be
reset prior to laptop use [a]. You ask IT to explain the importance of resetting default
passwords and convey how easily they are discovered using internet searches during next
week’s cybersecurity awareness training.

Example 2
Your company decides to use cloud services for email and other capabilities that will
transmit FCI. Upon reviewing this requirement, you realize every user or device that
connects to the cloud service must be authenticated. As a result, you work with your cloud
service provider to ensure that only properly authenticated users and devices are allowed
to connect to the system [a,c].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are unique authenticators used to verify user identities (e.g., usernames and passwords)
    [a]?
•   An example of a process acting on behalf of users could be a script that logs in as a person
    or service account [b]. Can the OSA show that it maintains a record of all of those service
    accounts for use when reviewing log data or responding to an incident?

Media Protection (MP)

###### MP.L1-B.1.VII – MEDIA DISPOSAL [FCI DATA]

Sanitize or destroy information system media containing Federal Contract Information
before disposal or release for reuse.

###### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-171A] 17

Determine if:
[a]     system media containing [FCI] is sanitized or destroyed before disposal; and
[b]     system media containing [FCI] is sanitized before it is released for reuse.

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 19

This requirement applies to all system media, digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or
reuse. Examples include: digital media found in workstations, network components,
scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, and mobile devices; and non-digital media
such as paper and microfilm. The sanitization process removes information from the media
such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques,
including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of
information to unauthorized individuals when such media is released for reuse or disposal.

Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods, recognizing that destruction
may be necessary when other methods cannot be applied to the media requiring sanitization.
Organizations use discretion on the employment of sanitization techniques and procedures
for media containing information that is in the public domain or publicly releasable or
deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or
disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes destruction, removing FCI from
documents, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the
redacted sections or words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing the words
or sections from the document. NARA policy and guidance control sanitization processes.
NIST SP 800-88 provides guidance on media sanitization.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Media can include a broad range of items that store information, including paper documents,
disks, tapes, digital photography, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, and mobile phones. It is important
to know what information is on media so that you can handle it properly. If there is FCI, you
or someone in your company should either:
•   shred or destroy the device before disposal so it cannot be read; or
•   clean or purge the information, if you want to reuse the device.
See NIST Special Publication 800-88, Revision 1, Guidelines for Media Sanitization, for more
information.

Example
As you pack for an office move, you find some old CDs in a file cabinet. You determine that
one has FCI from a project your company did for the DoD. You shred the CD rather than
simply throwing it in the trash [a].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Is all managed data storage erased, encrypted, or destroyed using mechanisms to ensure
    that no usable data is retrievable [a,b]?

badges, identification cards, and smart cards. Organizations determine the strength of
authorization credentials needed consistent with applicable laws, directives, policies,

regulations, standards, procedures, and guidelines. This requirement applies only to areas
within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible.
Limiting physical access to equipment may include placing equipment in locked rooms or
other secured areas and allowing access to authorized individuals only, and placing
equipment in locations that can be monitored by organizational personnel. Computing
devices, external disk drives, networking devices, monitors, printers, copiers, scanners,
facsimile machines, and audio devices are examples of equipment.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

This addresses the company’s physical space (e.g., office, testing environments, equipment
rooms), technical assets, and non-technical assets that need to be protected from
unauthorized physical access. Specific environments are limited to authorized employees,
and access is controlled with badges, electronic locks, physical key locks, etc.
Output devices, such as printers, are placed in areas where their use does not expose data to
unauthorized individuals. Lists of personnel with authorized access are developed and
maintained, and personnel are issued appropriate authorization credentials.

Example
You manage a DoD project that stores FCI on computers used only by project team members
[b,c]. You work with the facilities manager to put locks on the doors to the areas where the
computers are stored and used [b,c,d]. Project team members are the only individuals issued
with keys to the space. This restricts access to only those employees who work on the DoD
project and require access.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are lists of personnel with authorized access developed and maintained, and are
    appropriate authorization credentials issued [a]?
•   Has the facility/building manager designated building areas as “sensitive” and designed
    physical security protections (e.g., guards, locks, cameras, card readers) to limit physical
    access to the area to only authorized employees [b,c,d]?
•   Are output devices such as printers placed in areas where their use does not expose data
    to unauthorized individuals [c]?

Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be
procedural (e.g., written log of individuals accessing the facility), automated (e.g., capturing
ID provided by a Personal Identity Verification (PIV) card), or some combination thereof.
Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to systems or
system components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. System components
(e.g., workstations, notebook computers) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible
with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.
Physical access devices include keys, locks, combinations, and card readers.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Do not allow visitors, even those people you know well, to walk around your facility without
an escort. All non-employees should wear special visitor badges and/or are escorted by an
employee at all times while on the property.
Make sure you have a record of who accesses your facility (e.g., office, plant, factory). You can
do this in writing by having employees and visitors sign in and sign out or by electronic
means such as badge readers. Whatever means you use, you need to retain the access records
for the time period that your company has defined.
Identifying and controlling physical access devices (e.g., locks, badges, key cards) is just as
important as monitoring and limiting who is able to physically access certain equipment.
Physical access devices are only strong protection if you know who has them and what access
they allow. Physical access devices can be managed using manual or automatic processes
such a list of who is assigned what key, or updating the badge access system as personnel
change roles.

Example 1
Coming back from a meeting, you see the friend of a coworker walking down the hallway
near your office where FCI is stored. You know this person well and trust them, but are not
sure why they are in the building. You stop to talk, and the person explains that they are
meeting a coworker for lunch, but cannot remember where the lunchroom is. You walk the
person back to the reception area to get a visitor badge and wait until someone can escort
them to the lunchroom [a]. You report this incident, and the company decides to install a
badge reader at the main door so visitors cannot enter without an escort [a].

Example 2
You and your coworkers like to have friends and family join you for lunch at the office on
Fridays. Your small company has just signed a contract with the DoD in which your company
will receive FCI and you now need to document who enters and leaves your facility. You work
with the reception staff to ensure that all non-employees sign in at the reception area and
sign out when they leave [c]. You retain those paper sign-in sheets in a locked filing cabinet
for one year. Employees receive badges or key cards that enable tracking and logging access
to company facilities.

Example 3
You are a facility manager. A team member retired today and returns their company keys to
you. The project on which they were working requires access to areas that contain
equipment with FCI. You receive the keys, check your electronic records against the serial
numbers on the keys to ensure all have been returned, and mark each key returned [f].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are personnel required to accompany visitors to areas in a facility with physical access
    to organizational systems [a]?
•   Are visitors clearly distinguishable from regular personnel [b]?
•   Is visitor activity monitored (e.g., use of cameras or guards, reviews of secure areas upon
    visitor departure, review of visitor audit logs) [b]?
•   Are logs of physical access to sensitive areas (both authorized access and visitor access)
    maintained per retention requirements [c]?
•   Are visitor access records retained for as long as required [c]?
•   Are lists or inventories of physical access devices maintained (e.g., keys, facility badges,
    key cards) [d]?
•   Is access to physical access devices limited (e.g., granted to, and accessible only by,
    authorized individuals) [e]?
•   Are physical access devices managed (e.g., revoking key card access when necessary,
    changing locks as needed, maintaining access control devices and systems) [f]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 26

Communications can be monitored, controlled, and protected at boundary components and
by restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems. Boundary components
include gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and
virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a system security
architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected
subnetworks). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces in organizational systems includes
restricting external web communications traffic to designated web servers within managed
interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses.
Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the
implementation of security requirements associated with the use of such services.
Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and
consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may
also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission
services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions.
NIST SP 800-41 provides guidance on firewalls and firewall policy. NIST SP 800-125B
provides guidance on security for virtualization technologies.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Fences, locks, badges, and key cards help keep non-employees out of your physical facilities.
Similarly, your company’s IT network or system has boundaries that must be protected.
Many companies use a web proxy and a firewall.
When an employee uses a company computer to go to a website, a web proxy makes the
request on the user’s behalf, looks at the web request, and decides if it should let the
employee go to the website.
A firewall controls access from the inside and outside, protecting valuable information and
resources stored on the company’s network. A firewall stops unwanted traffic on the internet
from passing through an outside “fence” to the company’s networks and information
systems. Internal boundaries determine where data can flow, for instance a software
development environment may have its own boundary controlling, monitoring, and
protecting the data that can leave that boundary.
It may be wise to monitor, control, or protect one part of the company network from another.
This can also be accomplished with a firewall and limits the ability of attackers and
disgruntled employees from entering sensitive parts of your internal network and causing
damage.

Example
You are setting up the new network with an FCI enclave. You start by sketching out a simple
diagram that identifies the external boundary of your network and any internal boundaries
that are needed [a,b]. The first piece of equipment you install is the firewall, a device to

separate your internal network from the internet. The firewall also has a feature that allows
you to block access to potentially malicious websites, and you configure that service as well
[a,c,e,g]. Some of your coworkers complain that they cannot get to certain websites [c,e,g].
You explain that the new network blocks websites that are known for spreading malware.
The firewall sends you a daily digest of blocked activity so that you can monitor the system
for attack trends [c,d].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   What are the external system boundary components that make up the entry and exit
    points for data flow (e.g., firewalls, gateways, cloud service boundaries), behind which all
    system components that handle regulated data are contained? What are the supporting
    system components necessary for the protection of regulated data [a]?
•   What are the internal system boundary components that make up the entry and exit
    points for key internal data flow (e.g., internal firewalls, routers, any devices that can
    bridge the connection between one segment of the system and another) that separate
    segments of the internal network – including devices that separate internal network
    segments such as development and production networks as well as a traditional DMZ at
    the edge of the network [b]?
•   Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries monitored
    (e.g., connections are logged and able to be reviewed, suspicious traffic generates alerts)
    [c,d]?
•   Is data traversing the external and internal system boundaries controlled such that
    connections are denied by default and only authorized connections are allowed [e,f]?
•   Is data flowing in and out of the external and key internal system boundaries protected
    (e.g., applying encryption when required or prudent, tunneling traffic as needed) [g,h]?

                                                  SC.L1-b.1.xi – Public-Access System Separation [FCI Data]

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Publicly accessible systems should be separated from the internal systems that need to be
protected. Internal systems should not be placed on the same network as publicly accessible
systems, and access by default from DMZ networks to internal networks should be blocked.
One method of accomplishing this is to create a DMZ network, which enhances security by
providing public access to a specific set of resources while preventing connections from
those resources to the rest of the IT environment. Some OSAs may achieve a similar result
through the use of a cloud computing environment that is separated from the rest of the
company’s infrastructure.

Example
The head of recruiting at your firm wants to launch a website to post job openings and allow
the public to download an application form [a]. After some discussion, your team realizes it
needs to use a firewall to create a perimeter network to do this because your network
contains FCI [b]. You host the server separately from the company’s internal network where
FCI is stored and make sure the network on which it resides is isolated with the proper
firewall rules [b].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are any system components reachable by the public (e.g., internet-facing web servers,
    VPN gateways, publicly accessible cloud services) [a]?
•   Are publicly accessible system components on physically or logically separated
    subnetworks (e.g., isolated subnetworks using separate, dedicated VLAN segments such
    as DMZs) [b]?

or implementing testing software and firmware updates].

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-171 REV. 2] 30

Organizations identify systems that are affected by announced software and firmware flaws
including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws and report this information to
designated personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant updates
include patches, service packs, hot fixes, and anti-virus signatures. Organizations address
flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response
activities, and system error handling. Organizations can take advantage of available
resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) database or Common
Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database in remediating flaws discovered in
organizational systems.
Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware
may vary based on a variety of factors including the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of
the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require
more testing than other types of remediation. NIST SP 800-40 provides guidance on patch
management technologies.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

All software and firmware have potential flaws. Many vendors work to remedy those flaws
by releasing vulnerability information and updates to their software and firmware. OSAs
should have a process to review relevant vendor notifications and updates about problems
or weaknesses. After reviewing the information, the OSA should implement a patch
management process that allows for software and firmware flaws to be fixed without
adversely affecting the system functionality. OSAs should define the time frames within
which flaws are identified, reported, and corrected for all systems.

Example
You know that software vendors typically release patches, service packs, hot fixes, etc. and
want to make sure your software that processes FCI is up to date. You develop a policy that
requires checking vendor websites for flaw notifications every week [a]. The policy further
requires that those flaws be assessed for severity and patched on end-user computers once
each week and servers once each month [c,e]. Consistent with that policy, you configure the
system to check for updates weekly or daily depending on the criticality of the software [b,e].
Your team reviews available updates and implements the applicable ones according to the
defined schedule [f].

Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can be encoded in various formats (e.g.,
UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using
techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety
of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable
storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system
vulnerabilities.
Malicious code protection mechanisms include anti-virus signature definitions and
reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or
eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and
comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of
unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also
be present in custom-built software. This could include logic bombs, back doors, and other
types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions.
Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these
situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards including secure coding practices,
configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring
practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions
intended. NIST SP 800-83 provides guidance on malware incident prevention.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Malicious code purposely performs unauthorized activity that undermines the security of an
information system. A designated location may be a network device such as a firewall or an
end user’s computer.
Malicious code, which can be delivered by a range of means (e.g., email, removable media, or
websites), includes the following:
•   Virus – program designed to cause damage, steal information, change data, send email,
    show messages, or any combination of these things;
•   Spyware – program designed to secretly gather information about a person’s activity;
•   Trojan Horse – type of malware made to look like legitimate software and used by cyber
    criminals to get access to a company’s systems; and
•   Ransomware – type of malware that threatens to publish the victim’s data or perpetually
    block access to it unless a ransom is paid.
Consider use of anti-malware tools to stop or lessen the impact of malicious code.

Example
Your company’s IT team is buying new computers and wants to protect your company’s
information from viruses and spyware. The computers will be used to process, store, and
transmit FCI. They research anti-malware products, select an appropriate solution, and
deploy antivirus software on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available
[a,b].

techniques such as steganography. Malicious code can be inserted into systems in a variety
of ways including web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable
storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of system
vulnerabilities.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Consider use of anti-malware software to scan for viruses in your computer systems and
determine how often scans are conducted. Real-time scans look at the system whenever files
are downloaded, opened, and saved. Periodic scans check previously saved files against
updated malware information. Anti-malware software should be installed, run, and updated
on all hosts for which satisfactory antivirus software is available.

Example
Your company transmits FCI over email. You work with your company’s email provider to
enable enhanced protections that will scan all attachments to identify and quarantine those
that may be harmful prior to a user opening them [c]. In addition, you configure antivirus
software on each computer to scan for malicious code every day [a,b]. The software also
scans files that are downloaded or copied from removable media such as USB drives. It
quarantines any suspicious files and notifies the security team [c].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are files from media (e.g., USB drives, CD-ROM) included in the definition of external
    sources and are they being scanned [c]?
