Introduction
This document provides guidance in the preparation for and conduct of a Level 3 certification
assessment under the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) Program as set
forth in section 170.18 of title 32, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). Certification at each
CMMC level occurs independently. Guidance for conducting a Level 1 self-assessment can be
found in CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 1. Guidance for conducting both a Level 2 self-
assessment and Level 2 certification assessment, can be found in CMMC Assessment Guide –
Level 2. More details on the model can be found in the CMMC Model Overview document.
An Assessment as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means the testing or evaluation of security controls
to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended,
and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the security requirements for an
information system, or organization as defined in 32 CFR § 170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18. A Level
3 certification assessment as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 is the activity performed by the
Department of Defense (DoD) to evaluate the CMMC level of an Organization Seeking
Certification (OSC). For Level 3, assessments are conducted exclusively by the DCMA DIBCAC.
An OSC seeking a Level 3 certification assessment must have first achieved a CMMC Status of
Final Level 2 (C3PAO), as set forth in 32 CFR § 170.18(a), for all applicable information
systems within the CMMC Assessment Scope, and the OSC must implement the Level 3
requirements specified in 32 CFR § 170.14(c)(4). This is followed by the Level 3 certification
assessment conducted by the DCMA DIBCAC.
OSCs may also use this guide to perform Level 3 self-assessments (for example, in
preparation for an annual affirmation); however, they are not eligible to submit results from
a self-assessment in support of a Level 3 certification assessment. Only the results from an
assessment by DCMA DIBCAC are considered for award of the CMMC Statuses Conditional
Level 3 (DIBCAC) or Final Level 3 (DIBCAC). Level 3 reporting and affirmation requirements
can be found in 32 CFR § 170.18 and 32 CFR § 170.22.

Level 3 Description
Level 3 consists of selected security requirements derived from National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Special Publication (SP) 800-172, Enhanced Security
Requirements for Protecting Controlled Unclassified Information: A Supplement to NIST
Special Publication 800-171, with DoD-approved parameters where applicable. Level 3 only
applies to systems that have already achieved a Final Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC Status. Level 2
consists of the security requirements specified in NIST SP 800-171, Protecting Controlled
Unclassified Information in Nonfederal Systems and Organizations.




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                            1


                                                                                      Introduction



Like Level 2, Level 3 addresses the protection of Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI), as
defined in 32 CFR § 2002.4(h):
        Information the Government creates or possesses, or that an entity creates or
        possesses for or on behalf of the Government, that a law, regulation, or
        Government-wide policy requires or permits an agency to handle using
        safeguarding or dissemination controls. However, CUI does not include classified
        information (see paragraph (e) of this section) or information a non-executive
        branch entity possesses and maintains in its own systems that did not come from,
        or was not created or possessed by or for, an executive branch agency or an entity
        acting for an agency. Law, regulation, or Government-wide policy may require
        or permit safeguarding or dissemination controls in three ways: Requiring or
        permitting agencies to control or protect the information but providing no
        specific controls, which makes the information CUI Basic; requiring or
        permitting agencies to control or protect the information and providing specific
        controls for doing so, which makes the information CUI Specified; or requiring or
        permitting agencies to control the information and specifying only some of those
        controls, which makes the information CUI Specified, but with CUI Basic controls
        where the authority does not specify.
Level 3 provides additional protections against advanced persistent threats (APTs), and
increased assurance to the DoD that an OSC can adequately protect CUI at a level
commensurate with the adversarial risk, to include protecting information flow with the
government and with subcontractors in a multitier supply chain.

Purpose and Audience
This guide is intended for assessors, OSCs, cybersecurity professionals, and individuals and
companies that support CMMC efforts. This document can be used as part of preparation for
and conducting a Level 3 certification assessment.

Document Organization
This document is organized into the following sections:
•   Assessment and Certification: provides an overview of the Level 3 assessment
    processes set forth in 32 CFR § 170.18. It provides guidance regarding the scope
    requirements set forth in 32 CFR § 170.19(d).
•   CMMC-Custom Terms: incorporates definitions from 32 CFR § 170.4, definitions
    included by reference from 32 CFR § 170.2, and provides clarification of the intent and
    scope of specific terms as used in the context of CMMC.
•   Assessment Criteria and Methodology: provides guidance on the criteria and
    methodology (i.e., interview, examine, and test) to be employed during a Level 3
    assessment, as well as on assessment findings.

                                                                                     Assessment and Certification




Assessment and Certification
The DCMA DIBCAC will use the assessment methods defined in NIST SP 800-172A1, Assessing
Enhanced Security Requirements for Controlled Unclassified Information, along with the
supplemental information in this guide to conduct Level 3 certification assessments.
Assessors will review information and evidence to verify that an OSC meets the stated
assessment objectives for all of the requirements.
An OSC can obtain a Level 3 certification assessment for an entire enterprise network or for
specific enclave(s), depending on how the CMMC Assessment Scope is defined in accordance
with 32 CFR § 170.19(d).

Assessment Scope
Prior to conducting a CMMC Level 3 certification assessment, the Level 3 CMMC Assessment
Scope must be defined as addressed in 32 CFR § 170.19(d) and the CMMC Scoping Guide –
Level 3 document2. The CMMC Assessment Scope informs which assets within the OSC’s
environment will be assessed and the details of the assessment. The OSC must have achieved
a CMMC Status of Final Level 2 (C3PAO) of all systems included within the Level 3 CMMC
Assessment Scope prior to requesting the Level 3 assessment, as set forth in 32 CFR § 170.18.
The Level 3 assessment scoping is based on the requirements defined in 32 CFR § 170.19(d)
and supported by the CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 3 document. The CMMC Scoping Guide –
Level 3 document is available on the official CMMC documentation site at
https://dodcio.defense.gov/CMMC/Documentation/. If a Final Level 2 (C3PAO) CMMC
Status has not already been achieved for the desired CMMC Assessment Scope, the OSC may
not proceed with the Level 3 assessment.

# 1 NIST SP800-172A, March 2022

2 Note that an OSC ought to be mindful of their full Level 3 scoping in their request for a Level 2 assessment.




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                             4


                                                                             CMMC-Custom Terms




CMMC-Custom Terms
The CMMC Program has custom terms that align with program requirements. Although some
terms may have other definitions in open forums, it is important to understand these terms
as they apply to the CMMC Program.
The custom terms associated with Level 3 are:
•   Assessment: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means the testing or evaluation of security
    controls to determine the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
    operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting the
    security requirements for an information system or organization defined in 32 CFR §
    170.15 to 32 CFR § 170.18.
    o Level 3 certification assessment is the term for the activity performed by the DCMA
      DIBCAC to evaluate the information system of an OSC when seeking a CMMC Status of
      Level 3 (DIBCAC).
    o POA&M closeout certification assessment is the term for the activity performed by a
      C3PAO or DCMA DIBCAC to evaluate only the NOT MET requirements that were
      identified with POA&M during the initial assessment, when seeking a CMMC Status of
      Final Level 2 (C3PAO) or Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) respectively.
•   Assessment Objective: Means a set of determination statements that, taken together,
    expresses the desired outcome for the assessment of a security requirement. Successful
    implementation of the corresponding CMMC security requirement requires meeting all
    applicable assessment objectives defined in NIST SP 800–171A or NIST SP 800-172A.
•   Asset: Means an item of value to stakeholders. An asset may be tangible (e.g., a physical
    item such as hardware, firmware, computing platform, network device, or other
    technology component) or intangible (e.g., humans, data, information, software,
    capability, function, service, trademark, copyright, patent, intellectual property, image,
    or reputation). The value of an asset is determined by stakeholders in consideration of
    loss concerns across the entire system life cycle. Such concerns include but are not
    limited to business or mission concerns. Understanding assets is critical to identifying the
    CMMC Assessment Scope; for more information see CMMC Scoping Guide – Level 3.
•   CMMC Assessment Scope: As defined in 32 CFR § 170.4 means the set of all assets in the
    OSC’s environment that will be assessed against CMMC security requirements.
•   CMMC Status: The result of meeting or exceeding the minimum required score for the
    corresponding assessment. The CMMC Status of an OSA information system is officially
    stored in SPRS and additionally presented on a Certificate of CMMC Status, if the
    assessment was conducted by a C3PAO or DCMA DIBCAC.
    o Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC): Defined in 32 CFR § 170.18(a)(1)(ii). The OSC will
      achieve CMMC Status of Conditional Level 3 (DIBCAC) if a POA&M exists upon
      completion of the assessment and the POA&M meets all Level 3 POA&M requirements
      listed in 32 CFR § 170.21(a)(3).


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                            5


                                                                                      CMMC-Custom Terms



    •   Final Level 3 (DIBCAC): Defined in 32 CFR § 170.18(a)(1)(iii). The OSC will achieve
        Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) CMMC Status for the information systems within the CMMC
        Assessment Scope upon implementation of all security requirements and, if
        applicable a POA&M closeout assessment within 180 days. Additional guidance can
        be found in 32 CFR §170.21.
•   Enduring Exception: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means a special circumstance or
    system where remediation and full compliance with CMMC security requirements is not
    feasible. Examples include systems required to replicate the configuration of ‘fielded’
    systems, medical devices, test equipment, OT, and IoT. No operational plan of action is
    required but the circumstance must be documented within a system security plan.
    Specialized Assets and Government Furnished Equipment (GFE) may be Enduring
    Exceptions.
•   Event: Any observable occurrence in a system3. As described in NIST SP 800-171A4, the
    terms “information system” and “system” can be used interchangeably. Events sometimes
    provide indication that an incident is occurring.
•   Incident: An occurrence that actually or potentially jeopardizes the confidentiality,
    integrity, or availability of a system or the information the system processes, stores, or
    transmits or that constitutes a violation or imminent threat of violation of security
    policies, security procedures, or acceptable use policies.5
•   Monitoring: The act of continually checking, supervising, critically observing, or
    determining the status in order to identify change from the performance level required
    or expected at an organization-defined frequency and rate.6
•   Operational plan of action: As used in security requirement CA.L2-3.12.2, means the
    formal artifact which identifies temporary vulnerabilities and temporary deficiencies in
    implementation of requirements and documents how and when they will be mitigated,
    corrected, or eliminated. The OSA defines the format (e.g., document, spreadsheet,
    database) and specific content of its operational plan of action. An operational plan of
    action is not the same as a POA&M associated with an assessment.
•   Organization-defined: As determined by the OSC being assessed except as defined in
    the case of Organization-Defined Parameter (ODP). This can be applied to a frequency or
    rate at which something occurs within a given time period, or it could be associated with
    describing the configuration of a OSC’s solution.
•   Organization-Defined Parameters (ODPs): Selected enhanced security requirements
    contain selection and assignment operations to give organizations7 flexibility in defining
    variable parts of those requirements, as defined in NIST SP 800-172A. ODPs are used in
    NIST SP 800-172 and NIST SP 800-172A to allow Federal agencies, in this case the DoD,
    to customize security requirements. Once specified, the values for the assignment and
    selection operations become part of the requirement and objectives, where applicable.

 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                    6


                                                                            CMMC-Custom Terms



    The assignments and selections chosen for Level 3 are underlined in the requirement
    statement and objectives. In some cases, further specificity of the assignment or selection
    will need to be made by the OSC. In those cases, the term and abbreviation ODPs is used
    in the assessment objectives to denote where additional definition is required.
•   Periodically: Means occurring at a regular interval as determined by the OSA that may
    not exceed one year. As used in many requirements within CMMC, the interval length is
    organization-defined to provide OSC flexibility, with an interval length of no more than
    one year.
•   Security Protection Data: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means data stored or processed by
    Security Protection Assets (SPA) that are used to protect an OSC's assessed environment.
    Security Protection Data is security relevant information and includes, but is not limited
    to: configuration data required to operate an SPA, log files generated by or ingested by
    an SPA, data related to the configuration or vulnerability status of in-scope assets, and
    passwords that grant access to the in-scope environment.
•   System Security Plan (SSP): Means the formal document that provides an overview of
    the security requirements for an information system or an information security program
    and describes the security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements.
    The system security plan describes the system components that are included within the
    system, the environment in which the system operates, how the security requirements
    are implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems.
•   Temporary deficiency: As defined 32 CFR § 170.4 means a condition where
    remediation of a discovered deficiency is feasible and a known fix is available or is in
    process. The deficiency must be documented in an operational plan of action. A
    temporary deficiency is not based on an ‘in progress’ initial implementation of a CMMC
    security requirement but arises after implementation. A temporary deficiency may
    apply during the initial implementation of a security requirement if, during roll-out,
    specific issues with a very limited subset of equipment is discovered that must be
    separately addressed. There is no standard duration for which a temporary deficiency
    may be active. For example, FIPS-validated cryptography that requires a patch and the
    patched version is no longer the validated version may be a temporary deficiency.

                                                                 Assessment Criteria and Methodology




Assessment Criteria and Methodology
The CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3 leverages the assessment procedure described in
NIST SP 800-172A Section 2.1:
       An assessment procedure consists of an assessment objective and a set of
       potential assessment methods and objects that can be used to conduct the
       assessment. Each assessment objective includes a set of determination
       statements related to the CUI enhanced security requirement that is the subject
       of the assessment. Organization-defined parameters (ODP) that are part of
       selected enhanced security requirements are included in the initial
       determination statements for the assessment procedure. ODPs are included since
       the specified parameter values are used in subsequent determination
       statements. ODPs are numbered sequentially and noted in bold italics.
       Determination statements reflect the content of the enhanced security
       requirements to ensure traceability of the assessment results to the
       requirements. The application of an assessment procedure to an enhanced
       security requirement produces assessment findings. The findings are used to
       determine if the enhanced security requirement has been satisfied.
       Assessment objects are associated with the specific items being assessed. These
       objects can include specifications, mechanisms, activities, and individuals.
       •   Specifications are the document-based artifacts (e.g., policies, procedures,
           security plans, security requirements, functional specifications, architectural
           designs) associated with a system.
       •   Mechanisms are the specific hardware, software, or firmware safeguards
           employed within a system.
       •   Activities are the protection-related actions supporting a system that involve
           people (e.g., conducting system backup operations, exercising a contingency
           plan, and monitoring network traffic).
       •   Individuals, or groups of individuals, are people applying the specifications,
           mechanisms, or activities described above.
       Assessment methods define the nature and the extent of the assessor’s actions.
       The methods include examine, interview, and test.
       •   The examine method is the process of reviewing, inspecting, observing,
           studying, or analyzing assessment objects (i.e., specifications, mechanisms,
           activities).
       •   The interview method is the process of holding discussions with individuals
           or groups of individuals to facilitate understanding, achieve clarification, or
           obtain evidence.

        •   The test method is the process of exercising assessment objects (i.e., activities,
            mechanisms) under specified conditions to compare actual with expected
            behavior.
        The purpose of the assessment methods is to facilitate understanding, achieve
        clarification, and obtain evidence. The results obtained from applying the
        methods are used for making the specific determinations called for in the
        determination statements and thereby achieving the objectives for the
        assessment procedure.

Assessment objectives are provided for each requirement and are based on existing criteria
from NIST SP 800-172A. The criteria are authoritative and provide a basis for the assessor
to conduct an assessment of a requirement.

Methodology
During the CMMC certification assessment, the assessor will verify and validate that the OSC
has met the requirements. Because an OSC can meet the assessment objectives in different
ways (e.g., through documentation, computer configuration, network configuration, or
training), the assessor may use a variety of techniques, including one or more of the three
assessment methods described above from NIST SP 800-172A, to determine if the OSC meets
the intent of the requirements.
The assessor will follow the guidance in NIST SP 800-172A when determining which
assessment methods to use:
        Organizations [DoD] are not expected to use all of the assessment methods and
        objects contained within the assessment procedures identified in this
        publication. Rather, organizations have the flexibility to establish the level of
        effort needed and the assurance required for an assessment (e.g., which
        assessment methods and objects are deemed to be the most useful in obtaining
        the desired results). The decision on level of effort is made based on how the
        organization can accomplish the assessment objectives in the most cost-effective
        and efficient manner and with sufficient confidence to support the determination
        that the CUI enhanced security requirements have been satisfied.
The primary deliverable of an assessment is a compliance score and accompanying report
that contains the findings associated with each requirement. For more detailed information
on assessment methods, see Appendix C of NIST SP 800-172A.
Figure 1 illustrates an example of an assessment procedure for requirement AC.L3-3.1.3e.

Who Is Interviewed
The assessor has discussions with OSC staff to understand if a requirement has been
addressed. Interviews with applicable staff (possibly at different organizational levels)
determine if CMMC security requirements are implemented and if adequate resourcing,
training, and planning have occurred for individuals to perform the requirements.

What Is Examined
Examination includes reviewing, inspecting, observing, studying, or analyzing assessment
objects. The objects can be documents, mechanisms, or activities. The primary focus will be
to examine through demonstrations during interviews.
For some requirements, the assessor reviews documentation to determine if assessment
objectives are met. Interviews with OSC staff may identify the documents uses. Documents
need to be in their final forms; working papers (e.g., drafts) of documentation are not eligible
to be submitted as evidence because they are not yet official and are still subject to change.
Common types of documents that can be used as evidence include:
•   policy, process, and procedure documents;
•   training materials;
•   plans and planning documents; and
•   system-level, network, and data flow diagrams.




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                               10

This list of documents is not exhaustive or prescriptive. An OSC may not have these specific
documents, and other documents may be used to provide evidence of compliance.
In other cases, the requirement is best assessed by observing that safeguards are in place by
viewing hardware or associated configuration information or observe staff exercising a
process.

What Is Tested
Testing is an important part of the assessment process. Interviews tell the assessor what the
OSC staff believe to be true, documentation provides evidence of intent, and testing
demonstrates what has or has not been done and is the preferred assessment method when
possible. For example, staff may talk about how users are identified and documentation may
provide details on how users are identified, but seeing a demonstration of user identification
provides evidence that the requirement is met. The assessor will determine which
requirements or objectives within a requirement need demonstration or testing. Most
objectives will require testing.

Assessment Findings
The assessment of a CMMC security requirement results in one of three possible findings:
MET, NOT MET, or NOT APPLICABLE as defined in 32 CFR § 170.24. To achieve CMMC Status
of Final Level 3 (DIBCAC) as described in 32 CFR § 170.18, the OSC will need a finding of MET
or NOT APPLICABLE on all Level 3 security requirements.
•   MET: All applicable assessment objectives for the security requirement are satisfied
    based on evidence. All evidence must be in final form and a not draft. Unacceptable forms
    of evidence include working papers, drafts, and unofficial or unapproved policies. For
    each security requirement marked MET, it is best practice to record statements that
    indicate the response conforms to all objectives and document the appropriate evidence
    to support the response.
        •   Enduring Exceptions when described, along with any mitigations, in the system
            security plan shall be assessed as MET.
        •   Temporary deficiencies that are appropriately addressed in operational plans of
            action (i.e., include deficiency reviews, milestones, and show progress towards
            the implementation of corrections to reduce or eliminate identified
            vulnerabilities) shall be assessed as MET.
•   NOT MET: One or more objectives for the security requirement is not satisfied. During a
    Level 3 certification assessment, for each requirement objective marked NOT MET, the
    assessor will document why the evidence provided by the OSC does not conform.
•   NOT APPLICABLE (N/A): A security requirement and/or objective does not apply at the
    time of the assessment. For example, SI.L3-3.14.3e might be N/A if there are no Internet of
    Things (IoT), Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), Operational Technology (OT),



 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                              11


                                                             Assessment Criteria and Methodology



  Government Furnished Equipment (GFE), Restricted Information Systems, or test
  equipment included in the Level 3 CMMC Assessment Scope.
  If an OSC previously received a favorable adjudication from the DoD CIO indicating that
  a requirement is not applicable or that an alternative security measure is equally
  effective, the DoD CIO adjudication must be included in the system security plan to
  receive consideration during an assessment. Implemented security measures
  adjudicated by the DoD CIO as equally effective are assessed as MET if there have been
  no changes in the environment.
  Each assessment objective in NIST SP 800-171A and NIST SP 800-172A must yield a
  finding of MET or NOT APPLICABLE in order for the overall security requirement to be
  scored as MET. Assessors exercise judgment in determining when sufficient and
  adequate evidence has been presented to make an assessment finding.
  CMMC certification assessments are conducted and results are captured at the
  assessment objective level. One NOT MET assessment objective results in a failure of the
  entire security requirement.
  A security requirement can be applicable even when assessment objectives included in
  the security requirements are scored as N/A. The security requirement is NOT MET when
  one or more applicable assessment objectives is NOT MET.
  Satisfaction of security requirements may be accomplished by other parts of the enterprise
  or an External Service Provider (ESP), as defined in 32 CFR § 170.4. A security requirement
  is considered MET if adequate evidence is provided that the enterprise or ESP, implements
  the requirement objectives. An ESP may be external people, technology, or facilities that
  the OSC uses, including cloud service providers, managed service providers, managed
  security service providers, or cybersecurity-as-a-service providers.

                                                                         Requirement Descriptions




Requirement Descriptions
This section provides detailed information and guidance for assessing each Level 3 security
requirement. The section is organized first by domain and then by individual security
requirement. Each security requirement description contains the following elements as
described in 32 CFR § 170.14(c):
•   Requirement Number, Name, and Statement: Headed by the requirement identification
    number in the format DD.L#-REQ (e.g., AC.L3-3.1.2e); followed by the requirement short
    name identifier, meant to be used for quick reference only; and finally followed by the
    complete CMMC security requirement statement. In the case where the original NIST SP
    800-172 requirement requires an assignment and/or selection statement, the Level 3
    assignment (and any necessary selection) text is emphasized using underlining. See
    Section 2.2 in NIST SP 800-172 for the discussion on assignments and selections.
•   Assessment Objectives [NIST SP 800-172A]: Identifies the specific list of objectives
    that must be met to receive MET for the requirement as defined in NIST SP 800-172A and
    includes the Level 3 assignment/selection text (as appropriate). In cases where a Level 3
    assignment fully satisfies the definition(s) required in an organization-defined
    parameter (ODP) in NIST SP 800-172A, the ODP statement is not included as an objective,
    since that objective has been met by the assignment itself. However, when the
    assignment does not fully contain all required aspects of a NIST SP 800-172A ODP, the
    ODP is included as its own objective, using the original NIST SP 800-172A ODP number
    (e.g., “[ODP4]”). See the breakout box ORGANIZATION-DEFINED PARAMETERS in Section
    2.1 of NIST SP 800-172A for additional details on an ODP. In all cases where an
    assignment is used within an objective, it also emphasized using underlining.
•   Potential Assessment Methods and Objects [NIST SP 800-172A]: Defines the nature
    and extent of the assessor’s actions. Potential assessment methods and objects are as
    defined in NIST SP 800-172A. The methods include examine, interview, and test.
    Assessment objects identify the items being assessed and can include specifications,
    mechanisms, activities, and individuals.
•   Discussion [NIST SP 800-172]: Contains discussion from the associated NIST SP 800-172
    security requirement.
•   Further Discussion:
        •   Expands upon the NIST content to provide supplemental information on the
            requirement intent.
        •   Contains examples illustrating how the OSC might apply the requirement. These
            examples provide insight but are not intended to be prescriptive of how the
            requirement must be implemented, nor comprehensive of all assessment
            objectives necessary to achieve the requirement. The assessment objectives met
            within the example are referenced by letter in brackets (e.g., [a,d] for objectives
            “a” and “d”) within the text. Note that some of the examples contain company
            names; all company names used in this document are fictitious.

Access Control (AC)

###### AC.L3-3.1.2E – ORGANIZATIONALLY CONTROLLED ASSETS

Restrict access to systems and system components to only those information resources that
are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization.

###### ASSESSMENT OBJECTIVES [NIST SP 800-172A]

Determine if:
[a] Information resources that are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization are
    identified; and
[b] Access to systems and system components is restricted to only those information
    resources that are owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization.

###### POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT METHODS AND OBJECTS [NIST SP 800-172A]

Examine
[SELECT FROM: Access control policy; procedures addressing the use of external systems;
list of information resources owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization; security
plan; system design documentation; system configuration settings and associated
documentation; system connection or processing agreements; system audit records; account
management documents; other relevant documents or records].

Interview
[SELECT FROM: Organizational personnel responsible for restricting or prohibiting the use
of non-organizationally owned systems, system components, or devices; system and
network administrators; organizational personnel responsible for system security].

Test
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing restrictions on the use of non-organizationally
owned systems, components, or devices].

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Information resources that are not owned, provisioned, or issued by the organization include
systems or system components owned by other organizations and personally owned
devices. Non-organizational information resources present significant risks to the
organization and complicate the ability to employ a “comply-to-connect” policy or
implement component or device attestation techniques to ensure the integrity of the
organizational system.



 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                15

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Implementing this requirement ensures that an organization has control over the systems
that can connect to organizational assets. This control will allow more effective and efficient
application of security policy. The terms “has control over” provides policy for systems that
are not owned outright by the organization. Control includes policies, regulations or
standards that are enforced on the resource accessing contractor systems. Control may also
be exercised through contracts or agreements with the external party. Provisioned includes
setting configuration, whether through direct technical means or by policy or agreement. For
purposes of this requirement, GFE can be considered provisioned by the OSA.

Example 1
You are the chief network architect for your company. Company policy states that all
company-owned assets must be separated from all non-company-owned (i.e., guest or
employee) assets. You decide the best way forward is to modify the corporate wired and
wireless networks to only allow company-owned devices to connect [b]. All other devices
are connected to a second (untrusted) network that non-corporate devices may use to access
the internet. The two environments are physically separated and are not allowed to be
connected. You also decide to limit the virtual private network (VPN) services of the
company to devices owned by the corporation by installing certificate keys and have the VPN
validate the configuration of connecting devices before they are allowed in [b].

Example 2
You are a small company that uses an External Service Provider (ESP) to provide your audit
logging. Access between the ESP and the organization is controlled by the agreement
between the organization and the ESP. That agreement will include the policies, standards,
and configuration for the required access. Technical controls should be documented and in
place which limit the ESP’s access to the minimum required to perform the logging service.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Can the organization demonstrate a non-company-owned device failing to access
    information resources owned by the company [b]?
•   How is this requirement met for organizational devices that are specialized assets (GFE,
    restricted information systems) [a,b]?
•   Does the company allow employees to charge personal cell phones on organizational
    systems [b]?

###### AC.L3-3.1.3E – SECURED INFORMATION TRANSFER

Employ secure information transfer solutions to control information flows between security

Determine if:
[ODP1] Secure information transfer solutions are defined;
[a] Information flows between security domains on connected systems are identified; and
[b] Secure information transfer solutions are employed to control information flows
    between security domains on connected systems.

[SELECT FROM: System and network administrators; organizational personnel responsible
for information security; system developers].

Test
[SELECT FROM: Mechanisms implementing information flow enforcement policy;

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Organizations employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to
control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations within systems
and between connected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the
information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary
protection devices that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict
system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or
provide a message-filtering capability based on message content. Organizations also
consider the trustworthiness of filtering and inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware,
firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement.
Transferring information between systems in different security domains with different
security policies introduces the risk that the transfers violate one or more domain security


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                              17

policies. In such situations, information owners or information stewards provide guidance
at designated policy enforcement points between connected systems. Organizations
mandate specific architectural solutions when required to enforce logical or physical
separation between systems in different security domains. Enforcement includes prohibiting
information transfers between connected systems, employing hardware mechanisms to
enforce one-way information flows, verifying write permissions before accepting
information from another security domain or connected system, and implementing
trustworthy regrading mechanisms to reassign security attributes and labels.
Secure information transfer solutions often include one or more of the following properties:
use of cross-domain solutions when traversing security domains, mutual authentication of
the sender and recipient (using hardware-based cryptography), encryption of data in transit
and at rest, isolation from other domains, and logging of information transfers (e.g., title of
file, file size, cryptographic hash of file, sender, recipient, transfer time and Internet Protocol
[IP] address, receipt time, and IP address).

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

The organization implementing this requirement must decide on the secure information
transfer solutions they will use. The solutions must be configured to have strong protection
mechanisms for information flow between security domains. Secure information transfer
solutions control information flow between a Level 3 enclave and other CMMC or non-CMMC
enclaves. If CUI requiring Level 3 protection resides in one area of the environment or within
a given enclave outside of the normal working environment, protection to prevent
unauthorized personnel from accessing, disseminating, and sharing the protected
information is required. Physical and virtual methods can be employed to implement secure
information transfer solutions.

Example
You are the administrator for an enterprise that stores and processes CUI requiring Level 3
protection. The files containing CUI information are tagged by the company as CUI. To ensure
secure information transfer, you use an intermediary device to check the transfer of any CUI
files. The device sits at the boundary of the CUI enclave, is aware of all other CUI domains in
the enterprise, and has the ability to examine the metadata in the encrypted payload. The
tool checks all outbound communications paths. It first checks the metadata for all data being
transferred. If that data is identified as CUI, the device checks the destination to see if the
transfer is to another, sufficiently certified CUI domain. If the destination is not a sufficient
CUI domain, the tool blocks the communication path and does not allow the transfer to take
place. If the destination is a sufficient CUI domain, the transfer is allowed. The intermediary
device logs all blocks.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Has the organization defined the secure information transfer solutions it is using [b]?
•   Has the organization defined domains, boundaries, and flows between those domains
    that need to be controlled [a]?

•   Has the organization defined attributes to be associated with the CUI, and both source
    and destination objects [b]?
•   Has the organization defined metadata or some other tagging mechanism to be used as a
    means of enforcing CUI flow control [b]?
•   Has the organization defined filters to be used as a basis for enforcing flow control
    decisions [b]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

An effective method to detect APT activities and reduce the effectiveness of those activities
is to provide specific awareness training for individuals. A well-trained and security-aware
workforce provides another organizational safeguard that can be employed as part of a
defense-in-depth strategy to protect organizations against malicious code injections via
email or web applications. Threat awareness training includes educating individuals on the
various ways that APTs can infiltrate organizations, including through websites, emails,
advertisement pop-ups, articles, and social engineering. Training can include techniques for
recognizing suspicious emails, the use of removable systems in non-secure settings, and the
potential targeting of individuals by adversaries outside the workplace. Awareness training
is assessed and updated periodically to ensure that the training is relevant and effective,
particularly with respect to the threat since it is constantly, and often rapidly, evolving.
[NIST SP 800-50] provides guidance on security awareness and training programs.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

All organizations, regardless of size, should have a cyber training program that helps
employees understand threats they will face on a daily basis. This training must include
knowledge about APT actors, breaches, and suspicious behaviors.

Example
You are the cyber training coordinator for a small business with eight employees. You do not
have your own in-house cyber training program. Instead, you use a third-party company to
provide cyber training. New hires take the course when they start, and all current staff
members receive refresher training at least once a year [b]. When significant changes to the
threat landscape take place, the company contacts you and informs you that an update to the
training has been completed [c,d] and everyone will need to receive training [b]. You keep a
log of all employees who have gone through the cyber training program and the dates of
training.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does the organization have evidence that employees participate in cyber awareness
    training at initial hire and at least annually thereafter or when there have been significant
    changes to the threat [b]?

 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                   22


                                                              AT.L3-3.2.2e – Practical Training Exercises

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Awareness training is most effective when it is complemented by practical exercises tailored
to the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) of the threat. Examples of practical exercises
include unannounced social engineering attempts to gain unauthorized access, collect
information, or simulate the adverse impact of opening malicious email attachments or
invoking, via spear phishing attacks, malicious web links. Rapid feedback is essential to
reinforce desired user behavior. Training results, especially failures of personnel in critical
roles, can be indicative of a potentially serious problem. It is important that senior
management are made aware of such situations so that they can take appropriate
remediating actions.
[NIST SP 800-181] provides guidance on role-based security training, including a lexicon and
taxonomy that describes cybersecurity work via work roles.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

This requirement can be performed by the organization or by a third-party company.
Training exercises (including unannounced exercises, such as phishing training) should be
performed at various times throughout the year to encourage employee readiness. After
each exercise session has been completed, the results should be recorded (date, time, what
and who the training tested, and the percent of successful and unsuccessful responses). The
purpose of training is to help employees in all roles act appropriately for any given training
situation, which should reflect real-life scenarios. Collected results will help identify
shortcomings in the cyber training and/or whether additional instructional training may be
needed.
General exercises can be included for all users, but exercises tailored for specific roles are
important, too. Training tailored for specific roles helps make sure individuals are ready for
actions and events specific to their positions in a company. Privileged users receive training
that emphasizes what permissions their privileged account has in a given environment and
what extra care is required when using their privileged account.

Example
You are the cyber training coordinator for a medium-sized business. You and a coworker
have developed a specialized awareness training to increase cybersecurity awareness
around your organization. Your training includes social media campaigns, social engineering
phone calls, and phishing emails with disguised links to staff to train them beyond the
standard cybersecurity training [a,b].
To send simulated phishing emails to staff, you subscribe to a third-party service that
specializes in this area [a]. The service sets up fictitious websites with disguised links to help
train general staff against this TTP used by APTs [d]. The third-party company tracks the
individuals who were sent phishing emails and whether they click on any of the of the links
within the emails. After the training action is completed, you receive a report from the third-
party company. The results show that 20% of the staff clicked on one or more phishing email
links, demonstrating a significant risk to your company. As the cyber training coordinator,

you notify the individuals, informing them they failed the training and identifying the area(s)
of concern [e]. You send an email to the supervisors informing them who in their
organization has received training. You also send an email out to the entire company
explaining the training that just took place and the overall results [e].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are the individuals being trained and the results recorded [e]?
•   Are the training exercises performed [c]?
•   Are the exercises set up for all users? Are there tailored exercises based on roles within
    the organization (general users, users with specialized roles, and privileged users) [d]?
•   Does the organization have documentation recording the training exercises, who
    participated, and feedback provided to those who participated in a training session [c,e]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

The establishment and maintenance of an authoritative source and repository includes a
system component inventory of approved hardware, software, and firmware; approved
system baseline configurations and configuration changes; and verified system software and
firmware, as well as images and/or scripts. The authoritative source implements integrity
controls to log changes or attempts to change software, configurations, or data in the
repository. Additionally, changes to the repository are subject to change management
procedures and require authentication of the user requesting the change. In certain
situations, organizations may also require dual authorization for such changes. Software
changes are routinely checked for integrity and authenticity to ensure that the changes are
legitimate when updating the repository and when refreshing a system from the known,
trusted source. The information in the repository is used to demonstrate adherence to or
identify deviation from the established configuration baselines and to restore system
components from a trusted source. From an automated assessment perspective, the system
description provided by the authoritative source is referred to as the desired state. The
desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or deviations. [NIST SP
800-128] provides guidance on security configuration management, including security
configuration settings and configuration change control.
[NIST IR 8011-1] provides guidance on automation support to assess system and system
component configurations.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Trusted software, whether securely developed in house or obtained from a trusted source,
should have baseline data integrity established when first created or obtained, such as by
using hash algorithms to obtain a hash value that would be used to validate the source prior
to use of the software in a given system. Hardware in the repository should be stored in boxes
or containers with tamper-evident seals. Hashes and seals should be checked on a regular
basis employing the principle of separation of duties.

Example
You are the primary system build technician at a medium-sized company. You have been put
in charge of creating, documenting, and implementing a baseline configuration for all user
systems [c]. You have identified a minimum set of software that is needed by all employees
to complete their work (e.g., office automation software). You acquire trusted versions of the
software and build one or more baselines of all system software, firmware, and applications
required by the organization. The gold version of each baseline is stored in a secure
configuration management system repository and updated as required to maintain integrity
and security. Access to the build repository for updates and use is carefully controlled using
access control mechanisms that limit access to you and your staff. All interactions with the
repository are logged. Using an automated build tool, your team builds each organizational
system using the standard baseline

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

System components used to process, store, transmit, or protect CUI are monitored and
checked against the authoritative source (i.e., hardware and software inventory and
associated baseline configurations). From an automated assessment perspective, the system
description provided by the authoritative source is referred to as the desired state. Using
automated tools, the desired state is compared to the actual state to check for compliance or
deviations. Security responses to system components that are unknown or that deviate from
approved configurations can include removing the components; halting system functions or
processing; placing the system components in a quarantine or remediation network that
facilitates patching, re-configuration, or other mitigations; or issuing alerts and/or
notifications to personnel when there is an unauthorized modification of an organization-
defined configuration item. Responses can be automated, manual, or procedural.
Components that are removed from the system are rebuilt from the trusted configuration
baseline established by the authoritative source.
[NIST IR 8011-1] provides guidance on using automation support to assess system
configurations

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

For this requirement, the organization is required to implement automated tools to help
identify misconfigured components. Once under an attacker’s control, the system may be
modified in some manner and the automated tool should detect this. Or, if a user performs a
manual configuration adjustment, the system will be viewed as misconfigured, and that
change should be detected. Another common example is if a component has been offline and
not updated, the tool should detect the incorrect configuration. If any of these scenarios
occurs, the automated configuration management system (ACMS) will notice a change and
can take the system offline, quarantine the system, or send an alert so the component(s) can
be manually removed. Quarantining a misconfigured component does not require it to be
removed from the network. Quarantining only requires that a temporary limitation be put
in place eliminating the component’s ability to process, store, or transmit CUI until it is
properly configured. If a component has the potential of disrupting business operations then
the OSC should take extra care to ensure configuration updates are properly tested and that
components are properly configured and tested before being added to the network. Once
one of these actions is accomplished, a system technician may need to manually inspect the
system or rebuild it using the baseline configuration. Another option is for an ACMS to make
adjustments while the system is running rather than performing an entire rebuild. These
adjustments can include replacing configuration files, executable files, scripts, or library files
on the fly.

Example 1
As the system administrator, you implement company policy stating that every system
connecting to the company network via VPN will be checked for specific configuration
settings and software versioning before it is allowed to connect to the network, after it passes
authentication [a,b]. If any deviations from the authoritative baseline are identified, the


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                29

system is placed in a VPN quarantine zone (remediation network) using a virtual local area
network (VLAN) [b,c,d]. This VLAN is set up for system analysis, configuration changes, and
rebuilding after forensic information is pulled from the system. Once the system updates are
complete, the system will be removed from the quarantine zone and placed on the network
through the VPN connection.

Example 2
As the system administrator, you have chosen to use a network access control (NAC) solution
to validate system configurations before they are allowed to connect to the corporate
network [a]. When a system plugs into or connects to a local network port or the VPN, the
NAC solution checks the hash of installed system software [b,c]. If the system does not pass
the configuration check, it is put in quarantine until an administrator can examine it or the
ACMS updates the system to pass the system checks [d].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Can the organization explain the automated process that identifies, quarantines, and
    remediates a system when a misconfiguration or unauthorized system component is
    identified [a,b,c,d]?
•   Does the organization have a patching and rebuild process for all assets that may be taken
    offline [d]?

information, software version numbers, and— for networked components—the machine
names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include the manufacturer, supplier
information, component type, date of receipt, cost, model, serial number, and physical
location. Organizations also use automated mechanisms to implement and maintain
authoritative (i.e., up-to-date, complete, accurate, and available) baseline configurations for
systems that include hardware and software inventory tools, configuration management
tools, and network management tools. Tools can be used to track version numbers on
operating systems, applications, types of software installed, and current patch levels.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Organizations use an automated capability to discover components connected to the
network and system software installed. The automated capability must also be able to
identify attributes associated with those components. For systems that have already been
coupled to the environment, they should allow remote access for inspection of the system
software configuration and components. Another option is to place an agent on systems that
performs internal system checks to identify system software configuration and components.
Collection of switch and router data can also be used to identify systems on networks.

Example
Within your organization, you are in charge of implementing an authoritative inventory of
system components. You first create a list of the automated technologies you will use and
what each technology will be responsible for identifying [a]. This includes gathering
information from switches, routers, access points, primary domain controllers, and all
connected systems or devices, whether wired or wireless (printers, IoT, IIoT, OT, IT, etc.) [b].
To keep the data up-to-date, you set a very short search frequency for identifying new
components. To maximize availability of this data, all information will be placed in a central
inventory/configuration management system, and automated reporting is performed every
day [c]. A user dashboard is set up that allows you and other administrators to run reports
at any time.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Can the organization explain the process by which current inventory information is
    acquired [a]?
•   Is the organization able to produce an inventory of components on the network [b,c]?
•   Has the organization implemented a valid frequency for the component discovery
    solution [b,c]?
•   Can the organization demonstrate that the inventory is current and accurate [b]?
•   Has the organization developed a defined list of identifiable attributes for each
    component type, and is that list adequate to support component accountability [a]?
•   Is the organization able to track, monitor, and verify configuration items in accordance
    with the organization’s authoritative list of components [b,c]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Cryptographically-based and replay-resistant authentication between systems, components,
and devices addresses the risk of unauthorized access from spoofing (i.e., claiming a false
identity). The requirement applies to client-server authentication, server-server
authentication, and device authentication (including mobile devices). The cryptographic key
for authentication transactions is stored in suitably secure storage available to the
authenticator application (e.g., keychain storage, Trusted Platform Module [TPM], Trusted
Execution Environment [TEE], or secure element). Mandating authentication requirements
at every connection point may not be practical, and therefore, such requirements may only
be applied periodically or at the initial point of network connection.
[NIST SP 800-63-3] provides guidance on identity and authenticator management.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

The intent of this practice is to prevent unauthorized devices from connecting to one
another. One example satisfying this requirement is a web server configured with transport
layer security (TLS) using mutual authentication. At a lower level in the OSI stack, IPsec
provides application-transparent mutual authentication. Another example would be
implementing 802.1X technology to enforce port-based NAC. This is done by enabling 802.1X
on switches, wireless access points, and VPN connections for a given network. 802.1X defines
authentication controls for devices trying to access a given network. NAC controls
authorization and policy management. For this to be implemented, bidirectional
authentication must be turned on via 802.1X. Once successfully authenticated, the device
may communicate on the network. A final example, at the application-server level, involves
the use of Kerberos to control 1) which files a client can access and 2) the transmission of
sensitive data from the client to the server.

Example 1
You are the network engineer in charge of implementing this requirement. You have been
instructed to implement a technology that will provide mutual authentication for client
server connections. You implement Kerberos.
On the server side, client authentication is implemented by having the client establish a local
security context. This is initially accomplished by having the client present credentials which
are confirmed by the Active Directory Domain Controller (DC). After that, the client may
establish context via a session of a logged-in user. The service does not accept connections
from any unauthenticated client.
On the client side, server authentication requires registration, using administrator
privileges, of unique Service Provider Names (SPNs) for each service instance offered. The
names are registered in the Active Directory Domain Controller. When a client requests a
connection to a service, it composes an SPN for a service instance, using known data or data
provided by the user. For authentication, the client presents its SPN to the Key Distribution
Center (KDC), and the KDC searches for computers with the registered SPN before allowing
a connection via an encrypted message passed to the client for forwarding to the server.


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                  35

Example 2
You are the network engineer in charge of implementing this requirement. You have been
instructed to implement a technology that will provide authentication for each system prior
to connecting to the environment. You implement the company-approved scheme that uses
cryptographic keys installed on each system for it to authenticate to the environment, as well
as user-based cryptographic keys that are used in combination with a user’s password for
user-level authentication [a,c]. Your authentication implementation is finalized on each
system using an ACM solution. When a system connects to the network, the system uses the
system-level certificate to authenticate itself to the switch before the switch will allow it to
access the corporate network [a,c]. This is accomplished using 802.1x technology on the
switch and by authenticating with a RADIUS server that authenticates itself with the system
via cryptographic keys. If either system fails to authenticate to the other, the trust is broken,
and the system will not be able to connect to or communicate on the network. You also set
up a similar implementation in your wireless access point.

Example 3
You are the network engineer in charge of implementing the VPN solution used by the
organization. To meet this requirement, you use a VPN gateway server and public key
infrastructure (PKI) certificates via a certification authority (CA) and a chain of trust. When
a client starts a VPN connection, the server presents its certificate to the client and if the
certificate is trusted, the client then presents its certificate to the server [a]. If the server
validates the client certificate, an established communications channel is opened for the
client to finish the authentication process and gain access to the network via the VPN
gateway server [c]. If the client fails final authentication, fails the certification validation, or
the VPN gateway fails the certificate check by the client, the communication channel will be
denied.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Are cryptographic keys stored securely [a]?
•   Has the requirement been implemented for any of the three use cases, where applicable:
    client-server authentication, server-server authentication, and device authentication
    [b,c]?

[a] System components that are known, authenticated, in a properly configured state, or in
    a trust profile are identified;
[b] Automated or manual/procedural mechanisms to prohibit system components from

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Identification and authentication of system components and component configurations can
be determined, for example, via a cryptographic hash of the component. This is also known
as device attestation and known operating state or trust profile. A trust profile based on
factors such as the user, authentication method, device type, and physical location is used to
make dynamic decisions on authorizations to data of varying types. If device attestation is
the means of identification and authentication, then it is important that patches and updates
to the device are handled via a configuration management process such that the patches and
updates are done securely and do not disrupt the identification and authentication of other
devices.
[NIST IR 8011-1] provides guidance on using automation support to assess system
configurations.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

This requirement can be achieved in several ways, such as blocking based on posture
assessments, conditional access, or trust profiles. A posture assessment can be used to assess
a given system’s posture to validate that it meets the standards set by the organization before
allowing it to connect. Conditional access is the set of policies and configurations that control
devices receiving access to services and data sources. Conditional access helps an organization
build rules that manage security controls, perform blocking, and restrict components. A trust
profile is a set of factors that are checked to inform a device that a system can be trusted.

Example 1
In a Windows environment, you authorize devices to connect to systems by defining
configuration rules in one or more Group Policy Objects (GPO) that can be automatically
applied to all relevant devices in a domain [a]. This provides you with a mechanism to apply
rules for which devices are authorized to connect to any given system and prevent devices
that are not within the defined list from connecting [b,c]. For instance, universal serial bus
(USB) device rules for authorization can be defined by using a USB device’s serial number,
model number, and manufacturer information. This information can be used to build a trust
profile for a device and authorize it for use by a given system. You use security policies to
prevent unauthorized components from connecting to systems [c].




 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                 38

Example 2
You have been assigned to build trust profiles for all devices allowed to connect to your
organization’s systems. You want to test the capability starting with printers. You talk to your
purchasing department, and they tell you that policy states every printer must be from a
specific manufacturer; they only purchase four different models. They also collect all serial
numbers from purchased printers. You gather this information and build trust profiles for
each device [a,b]. Because your organization shares printers, you push the trust profiles out
to organizational systems. Now, the systems are not allowed to connect to a network printer
unless they are within the trust profiles you have provided [b,c].

Example 3
Your organization has implemented a network access control solution (NAC) to help ensure
that only properly configured computers are allowed to connect to the corporate network
[a,b]. The solution first checks for the presence of a certificate to indicate that the device is
company-owned. It next reviews the patch state of the computer and forces the installation
of any patches that are required by the organization. Finally, it reviews the computer’s
configuration to ensure that the firewall is active and that the appropriate security policies
have been applied. Once the computer has passed all of these requirements, it is allowed
access to network resources and defined as a trusted asset for the length of its session [a].
Devices that do not meet all of the requirements are automatically blocked from connecting
to the network [c].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   If the organization is using a manual method, is the method outlined in detail so any user
    will be able to follow it without making an error [b,c]?
•   If the organization is using an automated method, can the organization explain how the
    technology performs the task? Can they explain the steps needed to implement [a,b,c]?
•   Can the organization provide evidence showing they have trust profiles for specific
    devices [a,b,c]?
•   Can the organization explain how their system components authenticate to a system if
    they are not using trust profiles [b,c]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

A security operations center (SOC) is the focal point for security operations and computer
network defense for an organization. The purpose of the SOC is to defend and monitor an
organization’s systems and networks (i.e., cyber infrastructure) on an ongoing basis. The SOC
is also responsible for detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents in a
timely manner. The SOC is staffed with skilled technical and operational personnel (e.g.,
security analysts, incident response personnel, systems security engineers); in some
instances operates 24 hours per day, seven days per week; and implements technical,
management, and operational controls (e.g., monitoring, scanning, and forensics tools) to

monitor, fuse, correlate, analyze, and respond to security-relevant event data from multiple
sources. Sources of event data include perimeter defenses, network devices (e.g., gateways,
routers, and switches), and endpoint agent data feeds. The SOC provides a holistic situational
awareness capability to help organizations determine the security posture of the system and
organization. An SOC capability can be obtained in many ways. Larger organizations may
implement a dedicated SOC while smaller organizations may employ third-party
organizations to provide such a capability.
[NIST SP 800-61] provides guidance on incident handling. [NIST SP 800-86] and [NIST SP
800-101] provide guidance on integrating forensic techniques into incident response. [NIST
SP 800-150] provides guidance on cyber threat information sharing. [NIST SP 800-184]
provides guidance on cybersecurity event recovery.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Security operations centers are created to monitor and respond to suspicious activities
across an organization’s IT applications and infrastructure. A SOC may be implemented in a
variety of physical, virtual, and geographic constructs. The organization may also opt to not
hire their own staff but to engage a third-party external service provider to serve as their
SOC.
The SOC is typically comprised of multiple levels of cybersecurity analysts. Each tier of
cybersecurity analysts works on increasingly complex aspects of Incident Response. The SOC
may also have dedicated cybersecurity engineers to support configuration and management
of defensive cyber tools. The SOC may work with staff in IT operations who provide support
to the SOC.
SOC capabilities run 24/7, and while staff may not always be performing tasks for the SOC,
the capability alerts staff members and directs them to go to a facility or perform SOC actions
from a remote location. Staff members should be scheduled or on call to ensure they are
available when needed.

Example
You are the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) of a medium-sized organization. To
meet the goal of 24/7 SOC operation, you have decided to adjust the current SOC, which
operates five days a week for 12 hours a day, by minimizing active staff members and hiring
trusted expert consultants to have on call at all times (i.e., seven days a week, 24 hours a day)
[a,b]. You design your SOC to be remotely accessible so your experts can access your
environment when needed. You also decide to set up a very strong automated capability that
is good at identifying questionable activities and alerting the appropriate staff. You create a
policy stating that after an alert goes out, two members of the SOC team must remotely
connect to the environment within 15 minutes to address the problem. All staff members
also have regular working hours during which they perform other SOC activities, such as
updating information to help the automated tool perform its functions [c].

•   How does the organization enable 24/7 SOC capabilities? Does the organization have
    people in seats 24/7 or on-call members? If on-call members are used, what are the
    trigger and alerting mechanisms that allow for 24/7 coverage [a,b]?
•   Does the organization have sufficient trained full-time equivalent staff to enable 24/7
    SOC services [a,b]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

A cyber incident response team (CIRT) is a team of experts that assesses, documents, and
responds to cyber incidents so that organizational systems can recover quickly and
implement the necessary controls to avoid future incidents. CIRT personnel include, for
example, forensic analysts, malicious code analysts, systems security engineers, and real-
time operations personnel. The incident handling capability includes performing rapid
forensic preservation of evidence and analysis of and response to intrusions. The team
members may or may not be full-time but need to be available to respond in the time period
required. The size and specialties of the team are based on known and anticipated threats.
The team is typically pre-equipped with the software and hardware (e.g., forensic tools)
necessary for rapid identification, quarantine, mitigation, and recovery and is familiar with
how to preserve evidence and maintain chain of custody for law enforcement or
counterintelligence uses. For some organizations, the CIRT can be implemented as a cross
organizational entity or as part of the Security Operations Center (SOC).

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

The CIRT’s primary function is to handle information security incident management and
response for the environments the SOC oversees. The primary goals of the CIRT are triage
and initial response to an incident. They also communicate with all the proper people to
ensure understanding of an incident and the response actions, including collection of
forensic evidence, have been conveyed.
If and when an incident is detected by the organization’s SOC, the IR team is responsible for
handling the incident and communicating what has happened to the appropriate people
within the organization, as well to the authorities (as needed).
The deployment of a team does not necessarily mean they are “physically deployed.”
Deployment may simply mean connecting to a remote system in a manner that is equivalent
to being on the system’s keyboard. Remote access can provide just as much capability as local
access in many cases.
Some situations require physical access. For instance, if the company has a physically
isolated environment located at a remote location, a team must be physically present at the
remote facility to perform the duties required.

Example
You are the lead for an IR team within your organization. Your manager is the SOC lead, and
she reports to the chief information officer (CIO). As the SOC is alerted and/or identifies
incidents within the organization’s environments, you lead and deploy teams to resolve the
issues, including incidents involving cloud-based systems. You use a custom dashboard that
was created for your team members to view and manage incidents, perform response
actions, and record actions and notes for each case. You also have your team create an after
action report for all incidents to which they respond; this information is used to determine
if a given incident requires additional action and reporting [a].
One day, you receive a message from the SOC that your website has become corrupted.
Within minutes, you have a team on the system inspecting logs, analyzing applications,
preserving key information, and looking for evidence of tampering/attack [b]. Your team
runs through a procedure set for this specific incident type based on a handbook the
organization has created and maintains [c]. It is found that a cyberattack caused the
corruption, but the corruption caused a crash, which prevented the attack from continuing.
Your team takes note of all actions they perform, and at the end of the incident analysis, you
send a message to the website lead to inform them of the issue, case number, and notes
created by the team. The website lead has their team rebuild the system and validate that
the attack no longer works. At the end of the incident, the CISO and CIO are informed of the
issue.

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

If adverse information develops or is obtained about an individual with access to CUI which
calls into question whether the individual should have continued access to systems
containing CUI, actions are taken (e.g., preclude or limit further access by the individual,
audit actions taken by the individual) to protect the CUI while the adverse information is
resolved.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

According to Defense Counterintelligence and Security Agency, or DCSA (Industrial Security
Letter ISL 2011-04, revised July 15, 2020), adverse information consists of any information
that negatively reflects the integrity or character of an individual. This pertains to an
individual’s ability to safeguard sensitive information, such as CUI. Adverse information may
simply be a report showing someone has sent sensitive information outside the organization
or used unapproved software, against company policy. An organization may receive adverse
information about an individual through police reports, reported violations of company
policies (including social media posts that directly violate company policies), and revocation
or suspension of DoD clearance.
When adverse information is identified about a given individual, the organization should
take action to validate that information resources accessible by the individual have been
identified and appropriate protection mechanisms are in place to safeguard information and
system configurations. Based on organizational policy, an individual’s access to resources
may be more closely monitored or restricted until further review. Logs should be examined
to identify any attempt to perform unauthorized actions.

Example
You learn that one of your employees has been convicted on shoplifting charges. Based on
organizational policy, you report this information to human resources (HR), which verifies
the information with a criminal background check [a,b,c]. Per policy, you increase the
monitoring of the employee’s access to ensure that the employee does not exhibit patterns
of behavior consistent with an insider threat [d]. You maintain contact with HR as they
investigate the adverse information so that you can take stronger actions if required, such as
removing access to organizational systems.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does the organization define the protection mechanisms for organizational systems if
    adverse information develops or is obtained about an individual with access to CUI [d]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

The constant evolution and increased sophistication of adversaries, especially the APT,
makes it more likely that adversaries can successfully compromise or breach organizational
systems. Accordingly, threat intelligence can be integrated into each step of the risk
management process throughout the system development life cycle. This risk management
process includes defining system security requirements, developing system and security
architectures, selecting security solutions, monitoring (including threat hunting), and
remediation efforts.
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments. [NIST SP 800-39] provides
guidance on the risk management process. [NIST SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on
security architectures and systems security engineering. [NIST SP 800-150] provides
guidance on cyber threat information sharing.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

An organization consumes threat intelligence and improves their security posture based on
the intelligence relevant to that organization and/or a system(s). The organization can
obtain threat intelligence from open or commercial sources but must also use any
DoD-provided sources. Threat information can be received in high volumes from various
providers and must be processed and analyzed by the organization. It is the responsibility of
the organization to process the threat information in a manner that is useful and actionable
to their needs. Processing, analyzing, and extracting the intelligence from the threat feeds

and applying it to all organizational security engineering needs is the primary benefit of this
requirement. Note that more than one source is required to meet assessment objectives.

Example
Your organization receives a commercial threat intelligence feed from FIRST and
government threat intelligence feeds from both USCERT and DoD/DC3 to help learn about
recent threats and any additional information the threat feeds provide [b,c,d,e,f]. Your
organization uses the threat intelligence for multiple purposes:
•   To perform up-to-date risk assessments for the organization [a];
•   To add rules to the automated system put in place to identify threats (indicators of
    compromise, or IOCs) on the organization’s network [e];
•   To guide the organization in making informed selections of security solutions [c];
•   To shape the way the organization performs system monitoring activities [d];
•   To manage the escalation process for identified incidents, handling specific events, and
    performing recovery actions [f];
•   To provide additional information to the hunt team to identify threat activities [e];
•   To inform the development and design decisions for organizational systems and the
    overall security architecture, as well as the network architecture [b,c];
•   To assist in decision-making regarding systems that are part of the primary network and
    systems that are placed in special enclaves for additional protections [b]; and
•   To determine additional security measures based on current threat activities taking place
    in similar industry networks [c,d,e,f].

Potential Assessment Considerations

    used [a]?
•   Can the organization’s SOC or hunt teams discuss how they use the threat feed
    information after it is processed [e,f]?

malicious code in sandboxes, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
technologies and systems. Cyber threat hunting involves proactively searching
organizational systems, networks, and infrastructure for advanced threats. The objective is
to track and disrupt cyber adversaries as early as possible in the attack sequence and to
measurably improve the speed and accuracy of organizational responses. Indicators of
compromise are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational
systems at the host or network level and can include unusual network traffic, unusual file
changes, and the presence of malicious code.
Threat hunting teams use existing threat intelligence and may create new threat information,
which may be shared with peer organizations, Information Sharing and Analysis
Organizations (ISAO), Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC), and relevant
government departments and agencies. Threat indicators, signatures, tactics, techniques,
procedures, and other indicators of compromise may be available via government and non-
government cooperatives, including Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams, United
States Computer Emergency Response Team, Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity
Information Sharing Program, and CERT Coordination Center.
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on threat and risk assessments, risk analyses, and risk
modeling. [NIST SP 800-160-2] provides guidance on systems security engineering and
cyber resiliency. [NIST SP 800-150] provides guidance on cyber threat information sharing.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

For this requirement, threat hunting is conducted on an on-going aperiodic basis. On-going
aperiodic refers to activities that happen over and over but without an identifiable repeating
pattern over time. For threat hunting, on-going activities take place in an automated manner
(e.g., collecting logs, automated analysis, and alerts). Aperiodicity includes humans
performing the hunt activities, which take place on an as-needed or as-planned basis.
APTs can penetrate an environment by means that defeat or avoid conventional monitoring
methods and alert triggers—for example, by using zero-day attacks. Zero-day attacks
become known only after the attack has happened and alerts are sent via threat intelligence
feeds based on expert analysis. Because of the nature of zero-day attacks, automated alerts
do not generally trigger when the event occurs but the activity is captured in system logs and
forwarded for analysis and retention by the SIEM. Threat intelligence information is typically
used by hunt teams to search SIEM systems, system event and security logs, and other
components to identify activity that has already taken place on an environment. The hunt
team will identify systems related to the event(s) and pass the case to Incident Response
team for action on the event(s). The hunt team will also use indicators to identify smaller
components of an attack and search for that activity, which may help uncover a broader
attack on the environment.
Threat hunting can also look for anomalous behavior or activity based on an organization’s
normal pattern of activity. Understanding the roles and information flows within an
organization can help identify activity that might be indicative of adversary behavior before
the adversary completes their attack or mission.

Example
You are the lead for your organization’s cyber threat hunting team. You have local and
remote staff on the team to process threat intelligence. Your team is tied closely with the SOC
and IR teams. Through a DoD (DC3) intelligence feed, you receive knowledge of a recent
APT’s attacks on defense contractors. The intelligence feed provided the indicators of
compromise for a zero-day attack that most likely started within the past month. After
receiving the IOCs, you use a template for your organization to place the information in a
standard format your team understands. You then email the information to your team
members and place the information in your hunt team’s dashboard, which tracks all IOCs [a].
Your team starts by using the information to hunt for IOCs on the environment [b]. One of
your team members quickly responds, providing information from the SIEM that an HR
system’s logs show evidence that IOCs related to this threat occurred three days ago. The
team contacts the owner of the system as they take the system offline into a quarantined
environment. Your team pulls all logs from the system and clones the storage on the system.
Members go through the logs to look for other systems that may be part of the APT’s attack
[c]. While the team is cloning the storage system for evidence, you alert the IR team about
the issue. After full forensics of the system, your team has verified your company has been
hit by the APT, but nothing was taken and no additional attacks happened. You also alert DoD
(DC3) about the finding and discuss the matter with them. There is an after action report and
a briefing given to management to make them aware of the issue.

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

A properly resourced Security Operations Center (SOC) or Computer Incident Response
Team (CIRT) may be overwhelmed by the volume of information generated by the
proliferation of security tools and appliances unless it employs advanced automation and
analytics to analyze the data. Advanced automation and predictive analytics capabilities are
typically supported by artificial intelligence concepts and machine learning. Examples
include Automated Workflow Operations, Automated Threat Discovery and Response
(which includes broad-based collection, context-based analysis, and adaptive response
capabilities), and machine-assisted decision tools.
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments and risk analyses.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Advanced automation includes tools to correlate and reduce the cyber data overload created
by defensive tools, making the data understandable to the analyst. Automation also allows
the defensive mechanisms to respond rapidly when adversary events are identified.
Examples of such capabilities are SIEM; Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response
(SOAR); and Extended Detection and Response (XDR) tools. An example of an automated
rapid response action is a security alert being pushed to the SIEM while the organization’s
SOAR solution communicates to the network firewall to block communications to the remote
system identified in the security alert.
SIEM is primarily a log collection tool intended to support data storage and analysis. It
collects and sends alerts to security personnel for further investigation. SOAR is a software
stack that enables an organization to collect data about security threats and respond to
security events without human assistance in order to improve security operations.
Orchestration connects and integrates disparate internal and external tools. Automation, fed
by the data and alerts collected from security orchestration, ingests and analyzes data and
creates repeated, automated responses. SOAR incorporates these capabilities based on the
SIEM data and enables disparate security tools to coordinate with one another. SOAR can use
artificial intelligence to predict and respond to similar future threats, if such tools are
employed.
XDR streamlines security data ingestion, analysis, prevention, and remediation workflows
across an organization’s entire security stack, providing a single console to view and act on
threat data. However, the presence of these tools by themselves does not necessarily provide
an advanced capability. It is essential that the security team employ critical thinking in
support of the intrusion detection and threat hunting processes.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization. The organization holds
and processes CUI in an enterprise. To protect that data, you want to minimize phishing
attacks through the use of Security Orchestration and Automated Response (SOAR). Rather
than relying on analysts to manually inspect each inbound item, emails containing links
and/or attachments are processed by your automation playbook. Implementation of these


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                                55

processes involves sending all email links and attachments to detonation chambers or
sandboxes prior to delivery to the recipient. When the email is received, SOAR extracts all
URL links and attachments from the content and sends them for analysis and testing [a]. The
domains in the URLs and the full URLs are processed against bad domain and URL lists. Next,
a browser in a sandbox downloads the URLs for malware testing. Lastly, any attachments are
sent to detonation chambers to identify if they attempt malicious activities. The hash of the
attachments is sent to services to identify if it is known malware [b]. If any one of the items
triggers a malware warning from the sandbox, detonation chamber, domain/URL validation
service, attachment hash check services, or AV software, an alert about the original email is
sent to team members with the recommendation to quarantine it. The team is given the
opportunity to select a “take action” button, which would have the SOAR solution take
actions to block that email and similar emails from being received by the organization [c].

•   Has the organization implemented a security information and event management system
    [a,c]?
•   Has the organization implemented security orchestration, automation, and response
    tools [a,b,c]?

    packet captures (e.g., PCAP), or process logs with enrichment data, such as reputation or
    categorization data [c]?
•   Can the organization provide examples of both basic and emerging analytics used to
    analyze alert anomalies, e.g., both simple queries and unsupervised machine learning
    algorithms that both improve their effectiveness and automatically filter, reduce, or
    enrich alerting capabilities [c]?

security solution, including discussion of relevant analyses of alternatives and rationale for

key security-relevant architectural and design decisions. This level of detail is important as
the threat changes, requiring reassessment of the risk and the basis for previous security
decisions.
When incorporating external service providers into the system security plan, organizations
state the type of service provided (e.g., software as a service, platform as a service), the point
and type of connections (including ports and protocols), the nature and type of the
information flows to and from the service provider, and the security controls implemented
by the service provider. For safety critical systems, organizations document situations for
which safety is the primary reason for not implementing a security solution (i.e., the solution
is appropriate to address the threat but causes a safety concern).
[NIST SP 800-18] provides guidance on the development of system security plans.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

The System Security Plan (SSP) is a fundamental component of an organization’s security
posture. When solutions for implementing a requirement have differing levels of capabilities
associated with their implementation, it is essential that the plan specifically document the
rationale for the selected solution and what was acquired for the implementation. This
information allows the organization to monitor the environment for threat changes and
identify which solutions may no longer be applicable. While not required, it may also be
useful to document alternative solutions reviewed and differing levels of risk associated with
each alternative, as that information may facilitate future analyses when the threat changes.
In addition to the implementations required for Level 2 certification, which may not be risk
based, at Level 3, the SSP must carefully document the link between the assessed threat and
the risk-based selection of a security solution for the enhanced security requirements (i.e.,
all CMMC L3 requirements derived from NIST SP 800-172).

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization. Following CMMC
requirement RA.L3-3.11.1e – Threat Informed Risk Assessment, your team uses threat
intelligence to complete a risk assessment and make a risk determination for all elements of
your enterprise. Based on that view of risk, your team decides that requirement
RA.L3-3.11.2e – Threat Hunting is a requirement that is very important in protecting your
organization’s use of CUI, and you have determined the solution selected could potentially
add risk. You want to detect an adversary as soon as possible when they breach the network
before any CUI can be exfiltrated. However, there are multiple threat hunting solutions, and
each solution has a different set of features that will provide different success rates in
identifying IOCs.
As a result, some solutions increase the risk to the organization by being less capable in
detecting and tracking an adversary in your networks. To reduce risk, you evaluate five
threat hunting solutions and in each case determine the number of IOCs for which there is a
monitoring mechanism. You pick the solution that is cost effective, easy to operate, and
optimizes IOC detection for your enterprise; purchase, install, and train SOC personnel on its
use; and document the risk-based analysis of alternatives in the SSP. In creating that

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Threat awareness and risk assessment of the organization are dynamic, continuous, and
inform system operations, security requirements for the system, and the security solutions
employed to meet those requirements. Threat intelligence (i.e., threat information that has
been aggregated, transformed, analyzed, interpreted, or enriched to help provide the
necessary context for decision making) is infused into the risk assessment processes and
information security operations of the organization to identify any changes required to
address the dynamic threat environment.
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments, threat assessments, and risk
analyses.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

This requirement requires the organization to analyze threat intelligence and consider the
effectiveness of currently deployed cybersecurity solutions against existing, new, and
emerging threats. The goal is to understand the risk to the systems and the organization
based on threat intelligence and to make adjustments to security solutions to reduce the risk
to an acceptable level. Analysis of solutions should include analysis of operational system
settings of the deployed systems and not be solely a conceptual capability analysis. This
analysis includes verifying configuration settings are configured as desired by the
organization and have not been changed over time.
Threat information can be thought of as raw data that may be limited in terms of evaluating
the effectiveness of controls across the enterprise. For example, knowledge of a threat that
has not been correlated with other threats may result in evaluation of an implementation
that only provides partial protection for one set of systems when, in fact, the emerging threat
is applicable to the entire enterprise. Large organizations may also have the resources to
aggregate, transform, analyze, correlate, interpret, and enrich information to support
decision-making about adequacy of existing security mechanisms and methods.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization, which holds and
processes CUI. The organization subscribes to multiple threat intelligence sources [b]. In
order to assess the effectiveness of current security solutions, the security team analyzes any
new incidents reported in the threat feed. They identify weaknesses that were leveraged by
malicious actors and subsequently look for similar weaknesses in their own security
architecture[a,c]. This analysis is passed to the architecture team for engineering change
recommendations, including system patching guidance, new sensors, and associated alerts
that should be generated, and to identify ways to mitigate, transfer, or accept the risk
necessary to respond to events if they occur within their own organization [d].

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Supply chain events include disruption, use of defective components, insertion of
counterfeits, theft, malicious development practices, improper delivery practices, and
insertion of malicious code. These events can have a significant impact on a system and its
information and, therefore, can also adversely impact organizational operations (i.e.,
mission, functions, image, or reputation), organizational assets, individuals, other
organizations, and the Nation. The supply chain-related events may be unintentional or
malicious and can occur at any point during the system life cycle. An analysis of supply chain

risk can help an organization identify systems or components for which additional supply
chain risk mitigations are required.
[NIST SP 800-30] provides guidance on risk assessments, threat assessments, and risk
analyses. [NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1] provides guidance on supply chain risk management.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Organizations will have varying policies, definitions, and actions for this requirement. It is
important for a single organization to be consistent and to build a process that makes sense
for their organization, strategy, unique supply chain, and the technologies available to them.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization, which holds and
processes CUI. One of your responsibilities is to manage risk associated with your supply
chain that may provide an entry point for the adversary. First, you acquire threat information
by subscribing to reports that identify supply chain attacks in enough detail that you are able
to identify the risk points in your organization’s supply chain [a]. You create an organization-
defined prioritized list of risks the organization may encounter and determine the responses
to be implemented to mitigate those risks [b,c].
In addition to incident information, the intelligence provider also makes recommendations
for monitoring and auditing your supply chain. You assess, integrate, correlate, and analyze
this information so you can use it to acquire monitoring tools to help identify supply chain
events that could be an indicator of an incident. This monitoring tool provides visibility of
the entire attack surface, including your vendors’ security posture [d]. Second, you analyze
the incident information in the intelligence report to help identify defensive tools that will
help respond to each of those known supply chain attack techniques as soon as possible after
such an incident is detected, thus mitigating risk associated with known techniques.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Has the organization prioritized risks to the supply chain [a,b]?
•   Does the organization have viable service-level agreements that describe and enable
    responses to supply chain incidents [c,d]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

The growing dependence on products, systems, and services from external providers, along
with the nature of the relationships with those providers, present an increasing level of risk
to an organization. Threat actions that may increase risk include the insertion or use of
counterfeits, unauthorized production, tampering, theft, insertion of malicious software and
hardware, and poor manufacturing and development practices in the supply chain. Supply
chain risks can be endemic or systemic within a system element or component, a system, an

organization, a sector, or the Nation. Managing supply chain risk is a multifaceted
undertaking that requires a coordinated effort across an organization to build trust
relationships and communicate with both internal and external stakeholders. Supply chain
risk management (SCRM) activities involve identifying and assessing risks, determining
appropriate mitigating actions, developing SCRM plans to document selected mitigating
actions, and monitoring performance against plans. SCRM plans address requirements for
developing trustworthy, secure, and resilient systems and system components, including the
application of the security design principles implemented as part of life cycle-based systems
security engineering processes.
[NIST SP 800-161 Rev. 1] provides guidance on supply chain risk management.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

An organization is required to have a supply chain risk management plan that assesses and
responds to the identified risks from those organizations that provide IT products or
services, including any cloud or other third-party services with a role in the operation of the
system. The organization should be cognizant of services outside the scope of the system but
required for the operation of the system as part of their plan. Since the cyber environment
changes rapidly and continuously, it is equally important for the organization to update the
plan in response to supply chain cyber incidents or emerging information.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization, and you have created a
supply chain risk management plan [a,b,c]. One of the organization’s suppliers determines
that it has been the victim of a cyberattack. Your security team meets with the supplier to
determine the nature of the attack and to understand the adversary, the attack, the potential
for corruption of delivered goods or services, and current as well as future risks. The
understanding of the supply chain will help protect the local environment. Subsequently, you
update the risk management plan to include a description of the necessary configuration
changes or upgrades to monitoring tools to improve the ability to identify the new risks, and
when improved tools are available, you document the acquisition of defensive tools and
associated functionality to help mitigate any of the identified techniques [d].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does the organization’s current supply chain risk management plan apply across the
    enterprise, or does it only apply to a limited portion of the supply chain [b]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on systems or individual
system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries.
Penetration testing goes beyond automated vulnerability scanning. It is conducted by
penetration testing agents and teams with particular skills and experience that include
technical expertise in network, operating system, and application-level security. Penetration
testing can be used to validate vulnerabilities or determine a system’s penetration resistance
to adversaries within specified constraints. Such constraints include time, resources, and


 CMMC Assessment Guide – Level 3  Version 2.13                                              67

skills. Organizations may also supplement penetration testing with red team exercises. Red
teams attempt to duplicate the actions of adversaries in carrying out attacks against
organizations and provide an in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses or
deficiencies.
Organizations can use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing
activities. Penetration testing can be conducted internally or externally on the hardware,
software, or firmware components of a system and can exercise both physical and technical
controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes pretest analysis based on full
knowledge of the system, pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on the
pretest analysis, and testing designed to determine the exploitability of vulnerabilities. All
parties agree to the specified rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration
testing. Organizations correlate the rules of engagement for penetration tests and red
teaming exercises (if used) with the tools, techniques, and procedures that they anticipate
adversaries may employ. The penetration testing or red team exercises may be organization-
based or external to the organization. In either case, it is important that the team possesses
the necessary skills and resources to do the job and is objective in its assessment.
[NIST SP 800-53A] provides guidance on conducting security assessments.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

It is important that the organization has a repeatable penetration testing capability,
regardless of who performs the penetration testing. This requirement entails performing
tests against components of the organization’s architecture to identify cyber weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. It does not mean everything in the architecture requires penetration testing.
This requirement provides findings and mitigation strategies that benefit the organization
and help create a stronger environment against adversary efforts. It may be beneficial for
the organization to define the scope of penetration testing. The organization’s approach may
involve hiring an expert penetration testing team to perform testing on behalf of the
organization. When an organization has penetration testing performed, either by an internal
team or external firm, they should establish rules of engagement and impose limits on what
can be performed by the penetration test team(s).
Ensuring the objectivity of the test team is important as well. Potential conflicts of interest,
such as having internal testers report directly or indirectly to network defenders or an
external test team contracted by network defense leadership, must be carefully managed by
organizational leadership.
Reports on the findings should be used by the organization to determine where to focus
funding, staffing, training, or technical improvements for future mitigation strategies.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization. Leveraging a contract
managed by the CIO, you hire an external expert penetration team annually to test the
security of the organization’s enclave that stores and processes CUI [a,c]. You hire the same
firm annually or on an ad hoc basis when significant changes are made to the architecture or
components that affect security [b,c].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does the organization have internal team members who possess the proper level of
    expertise to perform a valued penetration testing effort [b]?
•   If the penetration testing is performed by an internal team, are the individuals
    performing the testing objectively [b]?
•   Is a penetration testing final report provided to the internal team responsible for
    organizational defense?
•   If previous penetration tests have been conducted, can the organization provide samples
    of penetration test plans, findings reports, and mitigation guidance based on the findings

addresses/different subnets; mechanisms supporting and/or implementing thin nodes].

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

A mix of physical and logical isolation techniques (described below) implemented as part of
the system architecture can limit the unauthorized flow of CUI, reduce the system attack
surface, constrain the number of system components that must be secure, and impede the
movement of an adversary. When implemented with a set of managed interfaces, physical
and logical isolation techniques for organizational systems and components can isolate CUI
into separate security domains where additional protections can be implemented. Any
communications across the managed interfaces (i.e., across security domains), including for
management or administrative purposes, constitutes remote access even if the
communications remain within the organization. Separating system components with
boundary protection mechanisms allows for the increased protection of individual
components and more effective control of information flows between those components.
This enhanced protection limits the potential harm from and susceptibility to hostile cyber-
attacks and errors. The degree of isolation can vary depending on the boundary protection
mechanisms selected. Boundary protection mechanisms include routers, gateways, and
firewalls separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks;
virtualization and micro-virtualization techniques; encrypting information flows among
system components using distinct encryption keys; cross-domain devices separating
subnetworks; and complete physical separation (i.e., air gaps).
System architectures include logical isolation, partial physical and logical isolation, or
complete physical isolation between subsystems and at system boundaries between
resources that store, process, transmit, or protect CUI and other resources. Examples
include:
•   Logical isolation: Data tagging, digital rights management (DRM), and data loss
    prevention (DLP) that tags, monitors, and restricts the flow of CUI; virtual machines or
    containers that separate CUI and other information on hosts; and virtual local area
    networks (VLAN) that keep CUI and other information separate on networks.
•   Partial physical and logical isolation: Physically or cryptographically isolated networks,
    dedicated hardware in data centers, and secure clients that (a) may not directly access
    resources outside of the domain (i.e., all applications with cross-enclave connectivity
    execute as remote virtual applications hosted in a demilitarized zone [DMZ] or internal
    and protected enclave), (b) access via remote virtualized applications or virtual desktop
    with no file transfer capability other than with dual authorization, or (c) employ
    dedicated client hardware (e.g., a zero or thin client) or hardware approved for multi-
    level secure (MLS) usage.
•   Complete physical isolation: Dedicated (not shared) client and server hardware;
    physically isolated, stand-alone enclaves for clients and servers; and (a) logically
    separate network traffic (e.g., using a VLAN) with end-to-end encryption using Public Key
    Infrastructure (PKI)-based cryptography or (b) physical isolation from other networks.

Isolation techniques are selected based on a risk management perspective that balances the
threat, the information being protected, and the cost of the options for protection.
Architectural and design decisions are guided and informed by the security requirements
and selected solutions. Organizations consider the trustworthiness of the isolation
techniques employed (e.g., the logical isolation relies on information technology that could
be considered a high value target because of the function being performed), introducing its
own set of vulnerabilities.
[NIST SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on developing trustworthy, secure, and cyber
resilient systems using systems security engineering practices and security design concepts.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

For this requirement, organizations must identify the systems or enclaves that need to be
isolated, then design and implement the isolation. The resulting isolation solutions are
documented or referenced in the SSP. Documentation will be dependent on the design
selected and may include a high-level diagram, but specific details that may change on some
frequency would be omitted. During an assessment, providing details such as subnet and
VLAN implementation identifiers, internal boundary protection hardware and software,
interface device functionality, and system configuration and Access Control List (ACL)
settings will be useful.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization, which holds and
processes CUI. You have decided to isolate the systems processing CUI by limiting all
communications in and out that enclave with cross-domain interface devices that implement
access control [a]. Your security team has identified all the systems containing such CUI,
documented network design details, developed network diagrams showing access control
points, documented the logic for the access control enforcement decisions, described the
interface and protocol to the identification and authentication mechanisms, and documented
all details associated with the ACLs, including review, updates, and credential revocation
procedures.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Has the organization clearly identified where they use physical, logical, or both isolation
    techniques [a]?
•   Can the organization describe the isolation techniques they have employed [a]?
•   Has the organization deployed subnetting, internal firewalls, and VLANs to control
    packet flow between internal segments [a]?
•   Does the organization employ metadata to inform isolation techniques [a]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Verifying the integrity of the organization’s security-critical or essential software is an
important capability since corrupted software is the primary attack vector used by
adversaries to undermine or disrupt the proper functioning of organizational systems. There
are many ways to verify software integrity throughout the system development life cycle.
Root of trust mechanisms (e.g., secure boot, trusted platform modules, Unified Extensible
Firmware Interface [UEFI]), verify that only trusted code is executed during boot processes.
This capability helps system components protect the integrity of boot firmware in
organizational systems by verifying the integrity and authenticity of updates to the firmware
prior to applying changes to the system component and preventing unauthorized processes
from modifying the boot firmware. The employment of cryptographic signatures ensures the
integrity and authenticity of critical and essential software that stores, processes, or
transmits, CUI. Cryptographic signatures include digital signatures and the computation and
application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality
of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.
Hardware roots of trust are considered to be more secure. This requirement supports 3.4.1e
and 3.4.3.e.
[FIPS 140-3] provides security requirements for cryptographic modules. [FIPS 180-4] and
[FIPS 202] provide secure hash standards. [FIPS 186-4] provides a digital signature
standard. [NIST SP 800-147] provides BIOS protection guidance. [NIST TRUST] provides
guidance on the roots of trust project.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Organizations verify the integrity of security critical and essential software every time that
software is executed. Secure boot mechanisms for firmware and a cryptographically
protected boot chain ensure the integrity of the operating system (OS) and security critical
software, and cryptographic techniques ensure the essential software has not been
tampered with after development prior to execution. If software is itself considered to be
CUI or if it uses CUI, this requirement ensures it has not been compromised.
Software and information integrity verification tools can help check the integrity during the
development process for those organizations developing software. As critical software is
updated, the integrity of any configuration data and the software must result in updated
signatures and an ongoing verification process.
Operating systems include mechanisms to validate digital signatures for installed software.
Most software packages use signatures to prove the integrity of the provided software, and
the organization should leverage these capabilities. Similarly, most hardware appliance
vendors have secure boot checks in place for their devices and built-in features that check
the digital signature of an upgrade/update package before they allow an upgrade to take
place. For locally developed software, the organization should sign the software to ensure its
integrity.

Example 1
You are responsible for information security in your organization. Your security team has
identified the software used to process CUI, and the organization has decided it is mission-
critical software that must be protected. You take three actions. First, you ensure all of the
platform’s configuration information used at boot is hashed and stored in a TPM [a]. Second,
you ensure that the platforms used to execute the software are started with a digitally signed
software chain to a secure boot process using the TPM. Finally, you ensure the essential
applications are cryptographically protected with a digital signature when stored and the
signature is verified prior to execution [b].

Example 2
Your organization has a software security team, and they are required to validate unsigned
essential software provided to systems that do not have TPM modules. The organization has
a policy stating no software can be executed on a system unless its hash value matches that
of a hash stored in the approved software library kept by the software security team [a]. This
action is performed by implementing software restriction policies on systems. The team
tests the software on a sandbox system, and once it is proven safe, they run a hashing
function on the software to create a hash value. This hash value is placed in a software library
so the system will know it can execute the software [b]. Any changes to the software without
the software security team’s approval will result in the software failing the security tests,
and it will be prevented from executing.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Does the organization use cryptographic signatures to ensure the integrity and
    authenticity of critical and essential software and data [b]?
•   Has the organization identified those devices that require integrity verification of the
    boot process [a]?
•   Does the organization use a TPM to store hashes of pre-run time configuration
    parameters for those systems [b]?
•   Does the organization leverage the TPM configuration hash to verify the hardware and
    software configuration is unchanged in order to determine that a system is trustworthy
    before running mission-essential applications [b,c]?
•   Does the organization use the TPM for remote attestation to determine to which extent
    information can be trusted from another system [b,c]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Organizations may have a variety of systems and system components in their inventory,
including Information Technology (IT), Internet of Things (IoT), Operational Technology
(OT), and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). The convergence of IT, OT, IoT, and IIoT
significantly increases the attack surface of organizations and provides attack vectors that
are challenging to address. Compromised IoT, OT, and IIoT system components can serve as
launching points for attacks on organizational IT systems that handle CUI. Some IoT, OT, and
IIoT system components can store, transmit, or process CUI (e.g., specifications or
parameters for objects manufactured in support of critical programs). Most of the current
generation of IoT, OT, and IIoT system components are not designed with security as a
foundational property and may not be able to be configured to support security functionality.
Connections to and from such system components are generally not encrypted, do not
provide the necessary authentication, are not monitored, and are not logged. Therefore,
these components pose a significant cyber threat. Gaps in IoT, OT, and IIoT security
capabilities may be addressed by employing intermediary system components that can
provide encryption, authentication, security scanning, and logging capabilities—thus,
preventing the components from being accessible from the Internet. However, such
mitigation options are not always available or practicable. The situation is further
complicated because some of the IoT, OT, and IIoT devices may be needed for essential
missions and business functions. In those instances, it is necessary for such devices to be
isolated from the Internet to reduce the susceptibility to cyber-attacks.
[NIST SP 800-160-1] provides guidance on security engineering practices and security
design concepts.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

Specialized Assets are addressed in the scoping guidance, which should be overlaid on this
requirement. The OSC must document Specialized Assets in the asset inventory; develop,
document, and periodically update system security plans; and include Specialized Assets in
the network diagram. The Specialized Asset section of the SSP should describe associated
system boundaries, system environments of operation, how security requirements are
implemented, and the relationships with or connections to other systems.
Specialized Assets within the Level 3 CMMC assessment scope must be either assessed
against all CMMC security requirements or separated into purpose-specific networks.
Specialized Assets may have limitations on the application of certain security requirements.
To accommodate such issues, the SSP should describe any mitigations.
Intermediary devices are permitted to mitigate an inability for the asset itself to implement
one or more CMMC requirements. An example of an intermediary device used in conjunction
with a specialized asset is a boundary device or a proxy.
The high-level list of Specialized Assets includes:

•   IoT and IIoT devices (physical or virtual) with sensing/actuation capability and
    programmability features;
•   OT used in manufacturing systems, industrial control systems (ICS), or supervisory
    control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems;
•   Restricted Information Systems, which can include systems and IT components that are
    configured based on government requirements; and
•   Test equipment.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization, which processes CUI on
the network, and this same network includes GFE for which the configuration is mandated
by the government. The GFE is needed to process CUI information [a]. Because the company
cannot manage the configuration of the GFE, it has been augmented by placing a bastion host
between it and the network. The bastion host meets the requirements that the GFE cannot,
and is used to send CUI files to and from the GFE for processing. You and your security team
document in the SSP all of the GFE to include GFE connectivity diagrams, a description of the
isolation mechanism, and a description of how your organization manages risk associated
with that GFE [a].

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Has the organization documented all specialized assets in asset inventory [a]?
•   Has the organization documented all specialized assets in the SSP to show how risk is
    managed [b]?
•   Has the organization provided a network diagram for specialized assets [a,b]?

###### DISCUSSION [NIST SP 800-172]

Threat information related to specific threat events (e.g., TTPs, targets) that organizations
have experienced, threat mitigations that organizations have found to be effective against
certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats
that can occur) are sourced from and shared with trusted organizations. This threat
information can be used by organizational Security Operations Centers (SOC) and
incorporated into monitoring capabilities. Threat information sharing includes threat
indicators, signatures, and adversary TTPs from organizations participating in threat-
sharing consortia, government-commercial cooperatives, and government-government
cooperatives (e.g., CERTCC, CISA/US-CERT, FIRST, ISAO, DIB CS Program). Unclassified
indicators, based on classified information but which can be readily incorporated into
organizational intrusion detection systems, are available to qualified nonfederal
organizations from government sources.

###### FURTHER DISCUSSION

One way to effectively leverage threat indicator information is to access human- or machine-
readable threat intelligence feeds. Effectiveness may also require the organization to create
TTPs in support of operational requirements, which will typically include defensive cyber
tools supporting incident detection, alerts, incident response, and threat hunting. It is
possible that this requirement will be implemented by a third-party managed service
provider, and in that case, it will be necessary to carefully define the boundary and
responsibilities between the OSC and the ESP to guarantee a robust implementation. It is also
important that the OSC validate threat indicator integration into the defensive cyber toolset
by being able to (1) implement mitigations for sample industry relevant indicators of
compromise (e.g., IP address, file hash), (2) identify sample indicators of compromise across
sample endpoints, and (3) identify sample indicators of compromise using analytical
processes on a system data repository.

Example
You are responsible for information security in your organization. You have maintained an
effective intrusion detection capability for some time, but now you decide to introduce a
threat hunting capability informed by internal and external threat intelligence [a,c,d,e]. You
install a SIEM system that leverages threat information to provide functionality to:
•   analyze logs, data sources, and alerts;
•   query data to identify anomalies;
•   identify variations from baseline threat levels;
•   provide machine learning capabilities associated with the correlation of anomalous data
    characteristics across the enterprise; and
•   categorize data sets based on expected data values.
Your team also manages an internal mitigation plan (playbook) for all known threats for your
environment. This playbook is used to implement effective mitigation strategies across the
environment [b]. Some of the mitigation strategies are developed by team members, and
others are obtained by threat feed services.

Potential Assessment Considerations
•   Which external sources has the organization identified as threat information sources [a]?
•   Does the organization understand the TTPs of key attackers [c,d]?
•   Does the organization deploy threat indicators to EDR systems, network intrusion
    detection systems, or both [c,d,e]?
•   What actions does the organization implement when a threat alert/indicator is signaled
    [c,d,e]?
•   Does the organization use internal threat capabilities within their existing security tools
    [e]?
•   How does the organization respond to a third-party notification of a threat indicator [e]?
